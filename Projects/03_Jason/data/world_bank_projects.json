network connectivity to less developed areas and low-income states and enhance the institutional capacity of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to better manage the highway network under the purview of the Ministry. There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is road improvement and maintenance. This component will include: civil works for widening and upgrading of approximately 400 km of existing single lane/intermediate lane national highways of Non-National Highway Development Project (NHDP) network in the project states, to two lane standards through item-rate contracts; providing supervision of quality control services, and others including costs towards land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, shifting of utilities. The second component of the project is institutional development component. The project will enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage the non-NHDP network through supporting specific intervention in five areas, viz., process improvements, network monitoring and management, financing, governance and accountability, and training. The third component of the project is road safety component. This component will pursue the objective of improving road safety through: 1) updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; 2) improving road accident data collection and analysis at central and state levels through implementation of the Road Accident Database Management System (RADMS) in project states; 3) strengthening road safety capacity at the central level, and 4)

China is to support the ambitious renewable energy scale-up program in China with a focus on efficiency improvement and reduction of incremental costs. There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is policy support. This will support developing and implementing Renewable Energy (RE) legislation and policies to achieve cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and smooth grid integration. The second component of the project is grid integration/access and technical design. This component will consist of targeted studies to ensure improved grid integration for large-scale grid-connected RE and grid access for distributed RE; and strategic and optimal deployment of key RE technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The third component of the project is technology improvement. Under this component the technology improvements will include, but not limited to: a) increasing efficiency of existing wind farms; b) improving quality and reliability and reducing costs of off-shore wind turbine technologies; c) increasing efficiency of existing large-scale grid connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) farms; and d) possibly improving Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) domestic manufacturing capacity. The fourth component of the project is pilot demonstration. This component will primarily provide technical assistance on twinning with selected international successful cities, the concept framework of new energy cities, planning, business and financing models, technical design, and policies for distributed generation applications in pilot new energy cities.

Program for Morocco is to support the concretization of key new constitutional governance principles and rights, aimed at increasing transparency and accountability and enhancing citizen engagement

The DPL has been prepared jointly with the European Union (EU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), leveraging a further US$ 250 million in support of common key policy actions such as the budget, procurement and open governance reforms. The programmatic approach is warranted by the scope and depth of the government's governance reform program, the implementation of which will require time, assistance, and flexibility. This operation is complemented by the transition fund project supporting the implementation of Morocco's new governance framework. This US$ 4 million grant provides technical assistance for the implementation of structural reforms fostering public engagement; performance based budgeting and fiscal decentralization. The series adopts a holistic and integrated approach to enhance its impact. It is supporting governance reforms across the public sector covering the central government; State owned Enterprises, or SoEs and agencies, local governments as well as inter-governmental relations. The Bank has provided policy advice and technical assistance for the design of most policy measures and laws supported by this DPL, with the support from the MNA multi-donor trust fund. The transition fund governance project will support the implementation of these structural reforms. While building on the long-standing engagement with public administration reform, under the Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL) series, this program supports the concretization of the performance budgeting reform through the adoption and implementation of the new organic budget law and procurement decree.

Social Resilience Project is to help Jordanian municipalities and host communities address the immediate service delivery impacts of Syrian refugee inflows and strengthen municipal capacity to support local economic development. There are two components to the project, the first component being municipal grants. This component will provide direct municipal grants to municipalities that are hosting the largest concentration of Syrians (i.e., weighting the number of Syrians hosted and their ratio to the host population). Reflecting the increased size of their populations, the Grants will allow municipalities to finance additional public services and programs to help improve living conditions, reduce communal tensions and enhance social cohesion for the benefit of the Jordanians and Syrians living in their jurisdictions. Finally, the second component is the institutional development and project management. This second component will finance two subcomponents: (i) subcomponent 2A - technical assistance to participating municipalities to plan, implement and manage activities funded by the Municipal Grant, as well as project management support to implementing agencies to coordinate, manage and oversee the project; and (ii) subcomponent 2B - capacity building of key Government agencies and vulnerable communities in emergency preparedness, and risk planning, management and financing.

Project (ACIP) for Azerbaijan is to facilitate the access of agricultural producers to markets by strengthening sanitary and phytosantiary services, enhancing selected value chains, and providing financial services to agribusiness enterprises. The project has four components. The first component is support for sanitary and phytosanitary services. This component aims to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of sanitary and phytosanitary services in order to reduce existing obstacles to agricultural and food trade. The component will be structured into following three sub-components: (i) food safety capacity building to establish a roadmap for comprehensive reforms, including key principles for the national food safety control policy and enforcement; (ii) upgrading plant health and phytosanitary system will support upgrading the State Phytosanitary Control Services (SPCS) which is mandated to ensure phytosanitary safety on the import, production, storage, and processing of plant and plant products; and (iii) animal health and veterinary services will support the strengthening the State Veterinary Services (SVS) and promotion of a complementary private veterinary sectors as key elements being considered to provide a suitable environment for improving and securing animal production. The second component is agribusiness value chain development. This component will help develop value chains by partially financing demand-driven investment proposals. It will also support activities for improving seed varieties and quality of seeds entering the market. It has following two sub-components: (i) investment and advisory support for agribusiness value chain development to: (a) provide development support for value chain participants to assist them to establish productive partnerships and prepare sub-project proposals for funding under the project, and (b) investment support for agribusiness value chains; and (ii) seed sector development will help to build on the experience of Second Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP-II) and will support the seed development chain that includes the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry (NRICH) and its research stations. The third component is financial services to agribusiness. This component will promote growth of agribusiness or agro-food processing enterprises through a line of credit to enhance their competitiveness, increase production and improve technologies, building thus on the sizeable results in lending to agribusinesses and improved skills of participating banks in appraising agriculture-related investment loans, achieved under the Bank's previous intervention. The fourth component is project management. Management responsibility for the project will come under the State Agency for Agricultural Credits (SAAC) within the ministry of agriculture. ACIP will be managed by the Project Management Unit (PMU) located in the State Agency for Agricultural Credits (SAAC)."}, "approvalfy": "2014", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "05-SEP-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20130913120356", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130913120356", "DocType": "PAD", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "20-JUN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081b286d7_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b286d7_1_0", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "18-JUN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0817db588_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817db588_1_0", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "27-SEP-2011", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2011092707221054", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011092707221054", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "02-AUG-2011", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2011080316305699", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011080316305699", "DocType": "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol."}], "lendprojectcost": 53250000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Rural markets"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "56,78,76,75", "borrower": "REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN", "sectorcode": "AB,AZ,YA", "sector3": {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 60, "Name": "Industry and trade"}, {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "board_approval_month": "September", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "75", "name": "Rural markets"}, {"code": "76", "name": "Rural non-farm income generation"}, {"code": "78", "name": "Rural services and infrastructure"}, {"code": "56", "name": "Other social protection and risk management"}], "countryname": "Republic of Azerbaijan", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122812/third-agricultural-development-credit-project?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 34500000, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "YA", "name": "Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}, {"code": "AZ", "name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, {"code": "AB", "name": "Agricultural extension and research"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c798"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, {"Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "OTHER", "prodline": "GE", "mjtheme": ["Environment and natural resources management", "Environment and natural resources management", "Environment and natural resources management"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND", "project_name": "Capturing Coral Reef Ecosystem Services (CCRES)", "mjthemecode": "11,11,11", "totalcommamt": 4500000, "id": "P123933", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "docty": "Project Paper,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 50, "Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, "lendinginstr": "Investment Project Financing", "countrycode": "4E", "sector2": {"Percent": 50, "Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, "totalamt": 0, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "11", "name": "Environment and natural resources management"}, {"code": "11", "name": "Environment and natural resources management"}, {"code": "11", "name": "Environment and natural resources management"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "East Asia and Pacific", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "Global Environment Project", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "East Asia and Pacific", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "East Asia and Pacific!$!4E", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The development objective of the Capturing Coral Reef and Related Ecosystem Services (CCRES) Project for East Asia and Pacific is to design and support the uptake of innovative models for valuing mangrove, sea-grass and coral reef ecosystem services with the potential to enhance the sustainability of marine-based enterprise and marine spatial planning in select coastal communities in Indonesia and the Philippines.

Five areas of priority, or policy areas, have been identified. First, better fiscal and financial management will enable policymakers to maximize benefits accruing from increased revenues from natural resources. Second, the revenue management framework in the hydropower and mining sectors should also be clearly defined to maximize revenues accruing over time to the government for development purposes while attracting good quality investment in the sector. Third, diversification of economic growth sources through a competitive private sector outside the resource sector is critical to ensure the sustainability of growth. As the natural resource sector is capital intensive, it does not provide abundant job opportunities, as opposed to manufacturing, agribusiness or services. Diversified sources of growth are also important to reduce vulnerability to developments and exogenous shocks in narrow set of sectors. Finally, the fourth and fifth priorities for translating increased revenues from the natural sectors into improved public service delivery are a strong public sector capable of managing these revenues effectively coupled with the establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms for schools and health facilities. PRSO 9 supports the establishment of a mining revenue committee and its reporting on fiscal regime policy issues and options in the sector.

The project will support the establishment and operation of Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC), created in partnership between private financial institutions, development finance institutions, and the ministry of finance. It will issue standard corporate bonds into the capital markets and subsequently issue loans (refinance and pre-finance) to mortgage lending institutions. The second component is establishment of a mortgage guarantee product, targeted at lower income borrowers. The project will fund the product development including testing and financial modeling, and then launch a competitive process, among private or public owned nonbank financial institutions to select a mortgage guarantee agent to implement the project. The project will also provide a line of credit to the project implementing entity on account of the mortgage guarantee agent for the issuance of mortgage guarantee products to eligible lenders. The third component is Housing Microfinance (HMF). This component aims to support the development and piloting of new and or emerging formal HMF products and to demonstrate a sustainable business case for these activities.

To achieve the development objectives, five components will create the basic institutions to support the reform processes. First, the project will improve the business climate by simplifying the processes of registering a business and obtaining a license, updating outdated legal framework governing business entry, and introducing electronic payment facilities for business and tax services. Second, fiscal transparency will be enhanced by removing legislative impediments to business and investment. Third, public financial management will improve through the creation of an independent commission for supervising public enterprises. Fourth, targeting social assistance will improve economic reform through the merging of the Social Welfare Agency and the Social Security Fund.

This component responds to the demand by Casamance agricultural cooperatives, and small-scale private operators for support to production, marketing, and commercialization of agricultural commodities. The component supports activities aimed at restoring the missing links in the rice, horticulture, and oysters value-chains. The second component is rural accessibility. This component will carry out a program aiming at improving accessibility of the most isolated rural communities and improving communities' access to roads leading to local markets and agricultural production zones. The third component is project implementation and capacity building in Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR). This component includes four sub-components: (i) strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders, including the Agence Nationale pour la Relance des Activites Economiques et Sociales en Casamance (ANRAC) through consolidation of peace building processes and the fundamentals of DDR for ex-combatants; (ii) carrying-out of three strategic studies on: (a) developing a cadastral plan; (b) developing a geo-reference map of interventions in Casamance; and (c) support to the government in the definition and implementation of a strategy on poles development, which integrates a fiscal

The Adaptation Fund (AF) was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programs in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto protocol and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. On December, 2012 the proposal submitted by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to the AF Board seeking access to resources in support of the 'Increasing Climate Resilience and Enhancing Sustainable Land Management in the Southwest of Buenos Aires Province' project in Argentina, was approved. On February 25, 2013, an agreement was signed between the AF Board and the IBRD, in order for the latter to serve as the project's multilateral implementing entity. The project will be funded by the AF for a total amount of US$ 4,296,817, of which US$ 336,617 correspond to the project cycle management fee available to the IBRD.

Service improvements will depend on training both the providers and users of services to be able to tailor information more effectively to users\u0092 needs. The geographical focus will be countrywide. The project will have social and economic benefits by managing risk in weather-related disasters that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable populations through improving forecasting, early warning systems and the observed climatology of Yemen. The project consists of the following four components: 1) the first component aims to improve climate resilience in Yemen through institutional strengthening and capacity building by provisioning of weather, climate and water services that meet stakeholders\u0092 needs by creating the conditions that ensure institutional, staffing and financial sustainability of the key providers; 2) the second component aims to upgrade and expand the observations networks for meteorology, agro-meteorology and hydrometeorology, ensuring that these networks are interoperable; 3) the third component provides for the implementation of a systematic upgrade of the weather, climate and water-related end-to-end services provided to all agencies, communities and individuals; 4) and the fourth component involves program management and knowledge sharing. This last component has three distinct subcomponents\u0097oversight of the overall implementation; support for the program coordination unit; and knowledge sharing including public education and

The series has been prepared in line with good practice principles for development policy operations in situations of fragility. The series focuses on areas of heightened importance in these settings: (1) strengthening public confidence in government by improving the transparency of budgets and accountability of public officials; (2) building investor confidence through rapid, visible improvements in the business climate; and (3) quickly creating economic opportunities by focusing on potential sources of growth and employment, particularly on labor-intensive exports. The reforms supported by the series reinforce its cross-cutting foundation of governance, including policies to reduce corruption, enhance transparency in public service and in the exploitation of natural resources, and strengthen the oversight role of civil society. Reforms to increase the resilience of the Ivorian economy include increasing the share of revenues from the main export crop, cocoa, received by farmers. Reforms to create jobs focus on improving the business climate, raising private investment, and supporting the growth of promising labor-intensive activities in rural areas, such as cashew production and cotton cultivation."}, "approvalfy": "2014", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "25-JUL-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130806141405", "DocURL":

Sector Restructuring Project for India is to: (a) strengthen the institutional and policy framework for integrated water resources management for the entire state; and (b) increase agricultural productivity and water productivity by supporting farmers in targeted irrigation areas. There are six components to the project, the first component being strengthening of state-level water institutions and inter-sector coordination. This component aims to provide support to the institutions in the state responsible for overall integrated water resources management and implementation of the state water policy. The second component is the modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems. The third component is the consolidation and enhancement of irrigation institutional reforms. This component will enhance the efficiency of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department (UPID) and strengthen the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) approach both in the department as well as in the community. The fourth component is the enhancing agriculture productivity and on-farm water management. This component (to be implemented directly by the Department of Agriculture) aims to improve the overall agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency at the field level. The fifth component is the feasibility studies and preparation activities for the next phase. This component is to prepare detailed surveys and designs for future third phase areas. These new areas will be identified by the Government of Uttar Pradesh and will make use of similar design principles (and the lessons learned) adopted under this second phase operation. Finally, the sixth component is the project coordination and monitoring."}, "approvalfy": "2014", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "24-OCT-2013", "EntityID": "090224b082034e25_1_0", "DocURL":

Gross Domestic Product, or GDP per capita. Most of the population is dispersed across rural areas of the archipelago, where they largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This caps food poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental shocks. Poverty rates are higher in urban areas, where traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates are high. A former British protectorate, the country became independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years of moderate but sustained economic growth and improvement in social indicators. A low-level conflict between 1998 and 2003, known as 'the tension,' brought the formal economy and many state functions to a halt. Real GDP per capita, which had been slowly eroding between 1996 and 1999, fell sharply between 2000 and 2002. An Australian-led and financed regional peacekeeping mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), stopped the violence and rapidly restored order and basic state functions, particularly in finance. The country has subsequently enjoyed a fairly good security situation, interrupted only by short-lived but destructive riots in 2006, mainly in the capital Honiara. RAMSI presently retains a police and military presence, as well as a large corps of civilians in advisory or in line functions, notably in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT).

C\u00f4te d\u0092Ivoire has built its economic foundation on agriculture, which currently accounts for 22 percent of GDP. This project focuses on the following geographical areas of production: the southwest around the Nawa region for cocoa, the southeastern regions of Sud Comoe and la M\u00e9 for rubber and oil palm, the central and northern regions of Hambol and Gontougo for cashew nuts, and the northern regions for cotton. Project activities are clustered around three technical components, combining value chains and geographic areas to facilitate implementation. The first component promotes a public-private partnership for sustainable cocoa development in southwest C\u00f4te d\u0092Ivoire. The second component supports the expansion and renewal of village plantations of oil palm and rubber in southeast C\u00f4te d\u0092Ivoire. The third component supports the cotton sector and promotion of cashew processing in central and northern C\u00f4te d\u0092Ivoire. Each of the three components is similarly structured with three sub-components, namely improving access to markets, improving productivity in a sustainable way, and introducing institutional development to the value chain. A fourth general component deals with coordination of project activities between the country\u0092s Ministry of Agriculture and the National Investment Program (NIAP)."}, "approvalfy": "2014",

At the Kabul and Lisbon Conferences in 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Afghan government agreed that full responsibility for security would be handed over by 2014. The country now faces the prospect of a drawdown of most international military forces that so far have supported the fight against the ongoing insurgency. At the same time, Afghanistan is gearing up for a presidential election in April 2014 which many anticipate to be a difficult process given the complex political environment and challenging logistics. Despite these steps, Afghanistan will need to rely heavily on donor financing to ensure the continued provision of public services and investment through the transition period. At the request of the authorities, this Development Policy Grant (DPG) series is designed to support the government's strategy for developing greater economic and fiscal self-reliance. The reform program is ambitious, especially in light of the upcoming elections, but it is strongly supported by the government, key stakeholders and donors. This program document describes the first in a series of two programmatic grants to Afghanistan. The first operation is in the amount of US$50 million, out of US$100 million for the programmatic series. A programmatic approach is proposed to carry on reform momentum and strengthen reform incentives during times in which political incentives for reforms are typically low due to upcoming election. Moreover, lessons from other operations in Afghanistan favor a carefully sequenced and continuous reform-approach."}, "approvalfy": "2014", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "04-SEP-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081ff0cf6_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ff0cf6_1_0", "DocType": "FIA", "DocTypeDesc": "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "10-JUL-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130718115058", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130718115058", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "05-JUL-2013", "EntityID": "000001843_20130711085607", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130711085607", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "05-JUN-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20120716101049", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120716101049", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 50000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 15, "Name": "Other social protection and risk management"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "27,86,25,23,56", "borrower": "GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN", "sectorcode": "BE,LS,LZ,BZ,BO", "sector3": {"Percent": 11, "Name": "General energy sector"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 34, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 33, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 11, "Name": "Energy and mining"}, {"Percent": 11, "Name": "Energy and mining"}, {"Percent": 11, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "board_approval_month": "August", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "56", "name": "Other social protection and risk management"}, {"code": "23", "name": "Macroeconomic management"}, {"code": "25", "name": "Administrative and civil service reform"}, {"code": "86", "name": "Other environment and natural resources management"}, {"code": "27", "name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}], "countryname": "Islamic State of Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P118027/af-development-policy-prog-series?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Closed", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "BO", "name": "Public administration- Financial Sector"}, {"code": "BZ", "name": "General public administration sector"}, {"code": "LZ", "name": "General energy sector"}, {"code": "LS", "name": "Other Mining and Extractive Industries"}, {"code": "BE", "name": "Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c7c0"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Hydropower"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Financial and private sector development", "Social dev/gender/inclusion", "Rural development", "Trade and integration"], "idacommamt": 339900000, "project_name": "Regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project", "mjthemecode": "4,7,10,5", "closingdate": "2020-12-31T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 339900000, "id": "P075941", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "LX", "name": "Energy and mining"}], "docty": "Project Information Document,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Procurement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Disbursement Letter,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Agreement,Disbursement Letter,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 100, "Name": "Hydropower"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "3A", "totalamt": 339900000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "4", "name": "Financial and private sector development"}, {"code": "7", "name": "Social dev/gender/inclusion"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "5", "name": "Trade and integration"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-08-06T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Africa", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Africa!$!3A", "envassesmentcategorycode": "A", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The objective of the Regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project is to increase power supply of electricity to the national grids of Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania.

This component will support a PBF pilot at the PHC level in eight rayons (or districts) in Khatlon and Sogd oblasts (regions). Under the PBF pilot, Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and their subsidiary Health Houses (HHs) will be eligible to receive a performance-based payment each quarter based on the quality and quantity of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) services delivered. The development and testing of the PBF scheme is currently being financed by a separate preparation grant from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). The second component is primary health care strengthening. This component will aim to improve the capacity of PHC providers to deliver quality services. It has following two sub-components: (i) quality improvement to finance the training of PHC doctors and nurses from the project districts and selected comparison districts in a six months family medicine training program; and (ii) physical infrastructure improvements to support the improvement of PHC facility infrastructure in the project districts.

The government is committed to its medium-term reforms in the face of high political, social and implementation risks. The DPO program takes into account the varying speeds of policy development and capacity limitations in the different reform areas. The core set of reforms for the two operations is fully identified. The program under the first operation of the series supports essential reform steps in the areas of governance, public financial management, private sector development, judicial reform, and energy.

The project has three components. The first component is maintaining access to essential healthcare services. This component aims to sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non- Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second component is supporting household basic needs. The objective of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ) ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The two subsidized products financed under this component are bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders. The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and verification. This component will finance: (i) the costs of two special purpose audits as required for component one; and (ii) the cost of an external auditor, acceptable to the World Bank, who will be appointed to audit the project financial statements covering the Project's 12 months lifetime and for both components one and two."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "28-JUL-2013", "EntityID":

The AF will: 1) expand the package of primary and secondary services in the current 18 rural districts; 2) introduce demand-and supply-side performance-based financing interventions on a pilot basis in two low-income urban health districts; and 3) extend the project implementation period to October 30, 2015. In addition, the project will strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) by rolling out and implementing Process Monitoring Evaluation (PME). The PME will generate evidence on contextual factors linked to performance of health providers and access to and utilization of maternal and child health (MCH) services in low-income urban areas supported by demand-and supply-side Results Based Financing (RBF) mechanisms.

The project has three components. The first component is strengthening the institutional, legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. This component aims to: (a) prepare an action plan to assess and reinforce the capacity of the National Federation of Microcredit Associations of Morocco (FNAM); and (b) support activities contributing to the strengthening of the legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework of the microfinance sector. This component will also finance goods, services, travel, and incremental operating costs incurred by the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the implementation and management of the project. It has following two sub-components: (a) prepare an action plan, including a comprehensive assessment to reinforce the capacity of the FNAM; and (b) carrying out studies to inform the development of a modern legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. The second component is strengthening the market infrastructure, product innovation and funding sources for microfinance. This component focuses on activities aimed at: (a) building common platforms improving the efficiency and effectiveness of microcredit associations; (b) building market infrastructure in support of microenterprises; and (c) promoting the strengthening and diversification of funding. It has following three sub-components: (i) promoting innovative common platforms and new products for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs); (ii) building market infrastructure for micro entrepreneurs; and (iii) strengthening and diversifying funding sources. The third component is integrating microfinance into a national financial inclusion strategy. This component aims to integrate the national microfinance roadmap into a wider, comprehensive national financial inclusion strategy. In a first step, this component aims to conduct a cross-cutting stocktaking exercise of all previous and ongoing activities aimed at promoting financial inclusion, putting the microfinance sector in a larger financial sector development context. In a second phase, this component aims to build on the findings of the aforementioned activities to develop a comprehensive national financial inclusion strategy, to be developed in a structured consultative process with all key public and private sector stakeholders, and develop an action plan with specific objectives and targets to achieve the aims of the strategy, as well as a clearly defined Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) framework to measure progress."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "27-JUN-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20130701100156", "DocURL":

The operation is in line with the strategic focus of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY10-13 and contributes directly to outcomes related to building sustainable agricultural development and market access. The CPS recognized that in order to sustain recent growth in the agriculture sector and its significant contribution to a robust growth in non-oil economy there is a deliberate need to increase agricultural productivity. The Nigerian Government has unprecedented opportunities to accelerate the country's development. Realizing the objectives of the transformation agenda will be essential to preserving stability in Nigeria. Agriculture is a major focal point of the transformation agenda. Agricultural growth in staples has the greatest impact on poverty reduction. The study identified significant potential for agricultural growth and poverty reduction through sector policies and investment, particularly those fostering improved productivity in food staples. One of the conclusions from the study is that Nigeria is unlikely to meet millennium development goal under its current growth path unless there is a significant improvement in agricultural productivity and in efficiency of public spending."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "04-JUN-2013", "EntityID": "000445729_20130610114511", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130610114511", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "13-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000001843_20130509143423", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130509143423", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 100000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 13, "Name": "Regulation and competition policy"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "78,77,75,40", "borrower": "FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA", "sectorcode": "YA,AB,AZ", "sector3": {"Percent": 19, "Name": "Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 56, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"Percent": 19, "Name": "Industry and trade"}], "board_approval_month": "June", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "40", "name": "Regulation and competition policy"}, {"code": "75", "name": "Rural markets"}, {"code": "77", "name": "Rural policies and institutions"}, {"code": "78", "name": "Rural services and infrastructure"}], "countryname": "Federal Republic of Nigeria", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P130012/nigeria-agriculture-sector-development-policy-operation?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "AZ", "name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, {"code": "AB", "name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, {"code": "YA", "name": "Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c7e0"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, {"Name": "Irrigation and drainage"}, {"Name": "Crops"}, {"Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, {"Name": "General public administration sector"}], "supplementprojectflg": "Y", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Rural development", "Rural development", "Social dev/gender/inclusion", "Rural development", "Rural development"], "idacommamt": 200000000, "impagency": "NATIONAL FADAMA COORDINATION OFFICE(NFCO)", "project_name": "THIRD NATIONAL FADAMA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - ADDITIONAL FINANCING", "mjthemecode": "10,10,7,10,10", "totalcommamt": 200000000, "id": "P130788", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "docty": "Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Paper,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan", "sector1": {"Percent": 45, "Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "NG", "sector2": {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Irrigation and drainage"}, "totalamt": 200000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "7", "name": "Social dev/gender/inclusion"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-06-28T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Nigeria", "sector4": {"Percent": 10, "Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Federal Republic of Nigeria!$!NG", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The objective of the Additional Financing (AF) for the Third National Fadama Development Project for Nigeria is to increase the incomes for users of rural lands and water resources within the Fadama areas in a sustainable manner throughout the recipient's territory.

Under the AF, specific to the six participating states, changes will be made to the intermediate indicators, to include state level and commodity specifics, and revision of targets to account for the additional financing. The new strategy seeks to attract private investment in processing and milling, and other commercial aspects of agriculture around nucleus farms, with associated small-holder linkages such as out-grower schemes and contracting farming arrangements. AF will draw lessons from a number of successful models of contract farming arrangement in the agribusiness subsector in Nigeria including the malting companies, Thai Farm and Dutch Agricultural Development and Trading Company (DADTCO) farms. Within this framework, private investors will enable a transformation process to higher levels of productivity, better quality and production."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate":

Project for Chad are to: 1) improve teaching and learning conditions in primary and upper secondary schools in selected areas; and 2) strengthen the system to facilitate evidence-based decision- making in the education sector. There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is improving teaching and learning conditions in primary schools. This component aims to: support improvements in the teaching and learning conditions in selected primary schools through the provision of quality infrastructure and furniture, textbooks, and improvements in teacher development and management; identify possible efficiency gains for the system; and strengthen the national strategies in each of targeted subsectors. The second component of the project is improving teaching and learning in upper secondary schools. This component aims to: support improvements in the teaching and learning conditions of upper secondary schools through the provision of teaching and learning material and in-service training of teachers, with a special focus on scientific disciplines; assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions; and inform the development of a strong subsector strategy. The third component of the project is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component will support project implementation by funding the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) coordination needs and by strengthening monitoring, evaluation, and evidence-based management capacities and activities of the Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy (MEFA) and Ministry of Secondary Education and Professional Training (MEFPS)."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs":

The project has three components. The first component is social protection system and project management. This component will seek to develop basic features of a social protection system, as outlined in the SSDP 2011-2013, and build government capacity to implement the project, through two interrelated sub-components. This component will focus on providing support to Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GOSS) in the development of a social protection policy, as well as putting in place the necessary implementation and coordination capacity. It has following two sub-components: (a) support for a social protection system. This sub-component will support GOSS to put in place the building blocks of a Social Protection (SP) system through assistance with the drafting of a social protection policy and putting in place a set of basic operational tools; and (b) capacity building and project management. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives, and Rural Development (MoAFCRD) will serve as the lead project implementing agency and will be responsible for the overall management and coordination of the project. The second component is public works. The objective of this component is to provide income for youth and women from poor households through a seasonal transfer, linked to participation in public works, in order to increase and sustain household assets, and smooth consumption during lean seasons. The third component is skills development. The objective of this component is to provide youth from poor and vulnerable households with access to livelihood opportunities through comprehensive skills development training comprised of technical, entrepreneurship and life skills. Through this component, short term skills training, based on market demand, will be provided to rural and urban poor youth, males as well as females, aged 18-30 years."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "07-JUN-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20130611100022", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130611100022", "DocType": "PAD", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "12-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0819d3a0a_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0819d3a0a_1_0", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "06-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0819d6879_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0819d6879_1_0", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}], "lendprojectcost": 21000000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 10, "Name": "Gender"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "54,51,55,59", "borrower": "MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMIC PLANNIN", "sectorcode": "BS,JB", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 75, "Name": "Health and other social services"}, {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "board_approval_month": "June", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "59", "name": "Gender"}, {"code": "55", "name": "Vulnerability assessment and monitoring"}, {"code": "51", "name": "Improving labor markets"}, {"code": "54", "name": "Social safety nets"}], "countryname": "Republic of South Sudan", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143915/ss-social-safety-net-skills-devt?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "JB", "name": "Other social services"}, {"code": "BS", "name": "Public administration- Other social services"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c7f6"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Vocational training"}, {"Name": "Other social services"}, {"Name": "Public administration- Other social services"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IBRD", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Social protection and risk management", "Social protection and risk management"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "DEPT.

The provincial MIS would provide for common data standards, information exchange through an integrated data sharing platform, coordination of social insurance benefits between prefectures for mobile beneficiaries\\ who straddle more than one prefecture, and the decision support system to inform provincial DHRSS management. (2) Rural worker training component will invest in technical training institutions with a particular focus on short-term training needs of current and potential migrants for both entry level and upgrading of skills, supported by a strengthened set of services to support post-training placement. In addition, there will be a strong focus on deepening school-industry partnerships to enhance the labor market relevance of training.

and productivity of irrigation water for project beneficiaries; and (ii) enhance the institutional framework and strengthen capacity for water security and climate resilience for the country. The project has three components. The first component is water resources development. This component will support climate resilience and water security for economic growth by financing water investments and by progressively building a longer-term investment pipeline. This component has following two sub-components: water sector investments; and water investment pipeline. The second component is effective water sector institutions. It will support the current sector institutions, as well as the preparation, implementation and full functioning of the new; legal and institutional framework resulting from alignments with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. It will also support integrated and participatory basin planning, including developing the requisite knowledge base and building capacity and institutional partnerships for effective water management and planning. The overall objective of this component will be to strengthen the enabling institutional and legal framework to sustainably advance Kenya's vast water sector investment program in order to achieve water security and climate resilience. It has following two sub-components: (i) support for water sector transition and reforms and (ii) strengthening water management and planning. The third component is support for project implementation. This component will support the establishment of the Project Management Unit (PMU) to provide for effective project implementation through the completion of the First Kenya Water Security and Climate Resilience Project (KWSCRP-1) and throughout the reform period. This component will finance the required office space, goods (e.g., vehicles), equipment (e.g., computers), staff, consultant services, travel, training and operating costs that will allow the PMU to carry out its responsibilities for project implementation."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "14-OCT-2013", "EntityID": "000356161_20131016151555", "DocURL":

While the credit will primarily translate into financing programs from the emergency priority action plan 2013-14, particular attention is given to the policy actions aimed at: (i) strengthening controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting pro-poor expenditures, (iii) restoring financial sustainability and investment capacity in power and irrigation sectors, and (iv) improving public financial and investment management. The operation fully shares the objectives of the World Bank Group's interim strategy note for FY14-15, and is aligned with the World Bank's Strategy for Africa. The operation is also part of a larger regional response to the crisis in the Sahel. While Mali is at the epicenter of the crisis, it is broadly understood that some of its causes, and the responses, have to be found at the regional Sahelian level. Thus, development policy operations are also being processed in Niger and Burkina Faso.

The component supports the CPG providing funding for LG infrastructure investment and management conditional on LG performance and basic functional capacity. The allocation for each LG is divided into two portions: (i) basic grant; and (ii) performance grant. The second component is targeted capacity support to targeted local governments, de-concentrated and central institutions and agencies. This component provides an integrated customized package of support to systematically address the gaps in the local government system. This component includes two sub-components: (i) targeted capacity support to local governments; and (ii) institutional support to national, regional and de-concentrated agencies. The third component is project management support and monitoring and evaluation. This component will provide support to project management of the program. Support will be given to the project coordination unit to deliver the following tasks: (i) provide overall project management and stakeholder coordination; (ii) overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation of all project activities and components, including oversight of LG compliance with fiduciary and safeguards requirements; (iii) contract and oversee independent consultant teams to undertake the annual independent Performance Assessment (PA) of all the participating LGs; (iv) a bi-annual audit of the quality and independence of the PA process; (v) a baseline, mid-term and

The second component is addition of a new production platform, wells and pipelines to develop the adjacent Marlin field within the CI-27 block. Under this component the Marlin field will be developed as a new separate four-leg fixed platform with eight slots and five wells.

Proactive integrated urban development strategies are urgently needed to address social exclusion, and create effective and long-term sustainable governance to benefit all residents. The value added of this operation lies in the potential knowledge partnership with the municipality. Belo Horizonte can become a leading laboratory of experimentation with new urban planning and management ideas and processes, in light of the knowledge the Bank brings to the client in specific issues such as housing development, resettlement practices, social programs, climate change adaptation and mitigation and results-based management. The operation began preparation in 2011 and has experienced delays; however no slippage or reversal of prior actions has occurred during this time.

There are three components to the project, the first component being quality improvement of basic education. This component aims at improving the accountability chain of the results chain for improving the quality of learning in the early grades of primary education at four levels. The first will be to provide performance financing education grants to District Education Authorities (IEF) under performance-based contracts (PBCs) between Regional Education Authorities and IEFs to improve the management of the education district and the quality and quantity of services they provide to schools in terms of supervision, support and advice, and teacher training. The second component is the strengthening equity in access to education. This component aims at reaching out-of-school children and providing them with a better quality education. This will be done by providing additional assistance to less advantaged areas in terms of new primary schools and by ensuring that all children notably in selected Daaras receive a quality basic education based on a well-defined curriculum. Finally, the third component is the supporting project management and capacity building."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "17-MAY-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130527091856",

Democratic Republic of Congo is to increase productivity and employment in selected value chains in target zones in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project has four components. The first component is agriculture value chains development in Bas-Congo. This component will increase the agricultural supply capabilities of farmers\u0092 organizations and provide basic rural infrastructure in order to strengthen the targeted value chains and better supply markets, including Kinshasa. This component will finance consultant services to provide technical assistance (TA) and support services to farmers organizations and benefiting institutions; works (the construction of technical and collection platforms, rural roads and upgrading of electricity network); and goods and equipment. This component has following two sub-components: (i) enhancing agricultural supply capabilities; and (ii) support to rural infrastructures. The second component is special economic zone of Maluku. The development of the Maluku Special Economic Zone (SEZ) will provide access to much needed industrial land equipped with critical infrastructure and a more friendly business environment for investors and private sector operators, all of which have been identified as binding constraints in the 2006 investment climate assessment. This component has following three sub-components: (a) facilitation of Public-Private Partnership (PPP); (b) strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries in SEZ development; and (c) physical infrastructure. The third component is proactive business development. This component will improve the business environment with a view to promoting investments and support productive activities in the targeted value chains and poles. It aims at supporting and operationalizing the government approach to Strategic Partnerships Along Value Chains (SPAVC) that was presented to and well received by development partners at the end of 2012 in Kinshasa. It has following three sub-components: (1) project development fund for investment promotion; (2) targeted regulatory reforms; and (3) trade facilitation at the port of Matadi in the Bas-Congo. The fourth component is coordination, monitoring, communication and impact. This component will strengthen the ability of government to implement the project in a coordinated and integrated manner based on existing structures, which will be strengthened through TA. It will also ensure coordination of the involved ministries. It will also be in charge of communication in collaboration with civil society organizations."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "11-JUN-2013", "EntityID":

Transport Project (MTP) are (i) to improve transport connectivity in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) so as to support national economic integration, (ii) to restore Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo (National Railway Company of DRC - SNCC) financial and operational viability, and (iii) to implement a sector wide governance plan and strengthen transport state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operational performance. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional financing grant in the amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 116.1 million (equivalent to US$180.00 million) to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for the ongoing project. The main purpose of the Additional Financing (AF) is to: (i) finance the costs associated with the implementation of part of original project first component (Recovery Plan of Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo, the National Railway Company of DRC - SNCC) that could not be funded because of an unanticipated financing gap and (ii) scale up the activities of project first component by expanding the SNCC work force downsizing program to Year 2013 retirees, and the activities of project second component in favor of river transport operations and civil aviation regulation. The AF will include a restructuring to introduce the following changes: (i) adjusting some results indicators and targets; (ii) splitting the SNCC workforce downsizing sub-category into two; (iii) amending several covenants in the original grant agreement to reflect changes in the political and economic situation as well as the actual time necessary to fulfill these covenants; and (iv) extending the project's closing date by 24 months to December 30, 2017, to complete the activities and fully achieve the development objectives."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate":

This component will finance following three sub-components: (i) internship pilot: this sub-component will aim at providing paid internships for an estimated 400 graduates through private enterprises on a cost-sharing basis; (ii) business development matching grants pilot: this program will provide up to 400 firms, depending on uptake, with a matching grant (typically 50 percent of the cost) for the procurement of business development services, training and goods to improve management practices, technology, or products or to reach new markets (domestic or export) as defined in a business development plan submitted by the firm; and (iii) project management. This third sub-component will support Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS) project management for this pilot. It will finance goods, services, travel (including international travel), and incremental operating costs incurred by SMEPS in the implementation and management of the project. The second component involves bank-executed activities, such as impact evaluation, technical assistance, and support. The second component will include the implementation of an impact evaluation and provision of technical assistance to the Government of Yemen to inform policies and programs on SME development and employment based on the outcomes and demonstrated effect of the pilot. The component will finance the costs of the impact evaluation and technical assistance provided to government entities and SMEPS, particularly on monitoring and evaluation."}, "approvalfy": "2013",

development objective of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) Sanitation and Water Project for Ghana is to increase access to improved sanitation and improved water supply in the GAMA, with emphasis on low income communities and to strengthen management of environmental sanitation in the GAMA. The project has four components. The first component is provision of environmental sanitation and water supply services to priority low income areas of the GAMA. The objective of this component is to increase the access to environmental sanitation and water supply services in low income areas of the GAMA with a strong focus on liquid sanitation. This component also includes the development and implementation of a hygiene and sanitation behavior change campaign targeted at low-income households, and a major learning and dissemination effort aimed at informing a large-scale institutionalized approach to upgrading sanitation in low-income communities. The second component is improvement and expansion of the water distribution network in the GAMA. The objective of this component is to improve and expand the water distribution network in order to provide piped water to the targeted people living in low income communities in the GAMA. This component will also support the acquisition and installation of water meters and other equipment, as well as the provision of services, aimed at improving water demand management and reducing nonrevenue water. The third component is planning, improvement and expansion of GAMA-wide environmental sanitation services. The objective of this component is to develop integrated GAMA-wide plans for liquid and solid waste management and drainage, and to finance critical elements to improve collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and septic sludge. Under this component the project will work closely with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to engage the private sector to strengthen sustainability of treatment facilities and expand services in target areas through business development support. The fourth component is institutional strengthening. This component will provide technical assistance (TA) to municipal, metropolitan and national institutions, including the promotion of private sector initiatives. It will also support the development of social accountability mechanisms aimed at applying pressure on those responsible for the services to ensure they are properly operated and maintained."},

This document describes a Euro 624.1 million (USD 800 million equivalent) Competitiveness and Savings Development Policy Loan (CSDPL) to Turkey. It is a one-tranche stand-alone operation. The objective of the program supported by the proposed operation is to facilitate Turkey's growth to high-income status by bolstering competitiveness and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing external vulnerabilities over the medium term. This operation is a critical part of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which was endorsed by the Executive Board on March 27, 2012. The DPL will contribute to the following expected CPS outcomes under the competitiveness pillar: (i) sustained macroeconomic and financial stability and strengthened exports, domestic savings, and external resilience and (ii) improved investment and business climate; deepened and broadened access to finance.

reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste and location. The additional grant would finance costs associated with scaling-up interventions in the districts where PAF is already active with its regular program (40 districts), and broaden it to an additional 15 districts to reach the areas in these districts that have been identified as most poor and excluded. The additional financing would address the financing gap to allow PAF II to do so. The additional financing is proposed for a period of four years. The changes to the project are: (a) extension of the closing date of the original project; (b) revised targets of outcome indicators to reflect scaling-up of investments and slight adjustments to proposed indicators; (c) renaming and broadening the original component C, innovations and special programs, to component C, product development, market linkages and pilots, to better describe the innovative activities proposed under the additional financing; and (d) renaming and broadening the original component E, administration of PAF II, to component E, project management, planning and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), to integrate monitoring and evaluation activities as well as consultancies (like technical audits and special studies) outside of PO support into component E."},

disease services in selected secondary-level health facilities. This project has three components: The first component is strengthening the institutional capacity to improve the quality of selected health interventions at Performance-based Financing (PBF) health facilities. This component aims to support improvements to the quality of care related to maternal health, child health, and infectious disease interventions at selected hospitals in Liberia through the provision of performance-based incentives to support: (a) improved clinical practice; (b) adherence to well-established and defined clinical and treatment protocols; (c) health worker motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic); (d) structural improvements (e.g. availability of drugs and commodities, and health facility rehabilitation); and, (e) improved management capacity, governance, monitoring and record keeping at health facilities. It has following two sub-components: (1) performance-based financing to address the systemic bottlenecks related to poor quality of care, and health system deficiencies; and (2) management and capacity building to provide intensive technical support to build the institutional capacity required to manage the PBF approach. The second component is improving health worker competencies to address key health-related concerns at selected health facilities. This component will complement efforts to improve the quality of care at target health facilities (discussed under first component), by improving the availability and competencies of health workers in these facilities, in critical specialist areas- obstetrics, pediatrics, general surgery and internal medicine. It has following two sub-components: (i) Graduate Medical Residency Program (GMRP) to support the design and implementation of a nationally accredited GMRP in defined critical specialist areas (obstetrics, surgery, pediatrics, and internal medicine, with a cross-cutting focus on anesthesiology); and (ii) in-service training programs to mid- level health cadres. This subcomponent will leverage the teaching capacity made available under subcomponent 2.i to provide specialized training in critical specialist areas to mid-level cadres (midwives, nurses, and Physician Assistant (PAs) in target hospitals as well as satellite health centers. The third component is project management. This component will support the operational capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) to effectively manage the project. This will include support to the operational costs of a project- specific unit i.e. the HSSP coordination office- within the MoHSW that will be responsible for coordinating project activities."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "23-SEP-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081f05c01_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081f05c01_1_0", "DocType": "ISRR", "DocTypeDesc": "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "03-MAY-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20130513101657", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130513101657", "DocType": "PAD", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "03-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081978756_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081978756_1_0", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "27-FEB-2013", "EntityID": "090224b08196dd64_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08196dd64_1_0", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "06-FEB-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0818fe1fb_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818fe1fb_1_0", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "01-FEB-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20130308121959", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130308121959", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "14-SEP-2012", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2012091810510293", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012091810510293", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}], "lendprojectcost": 15000000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Education for the knowledge economy"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "67,66", "borrower": "GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA", "sectorcode": "BC,ET,BQ,JA", "sector3": {"Percent": 21, "Name": "Tertiary education"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 46, "Name": "Health and other social services"}, {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 21, "Name": "Education"}, {"Percent": 8, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "board_approval_month": "May", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "66", "name": "Education for the knowledge economy"}, {"code": "67", "name": "Health system performance"}], "countryname": "Republic of Liberia", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P128909/liberia-health-systems-strengthening?lang=en", "source": "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "JA", "name": "Health"}, {"code": "BQ", "name": "Public administration- Health"}, {"code": "ET", "name": "Tertiary education"}, {"code": "BC", "name": "Central government administration"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c828"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"}, {"Name": "Public administration- Energy and mining"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "idacommamt": 105000000, "impagency": "ZESCO LTD.", "project_name": "Lusaka Transmission and Distribution Rehabilitation Project", "mjthemecode": "2", "closingdate": "2019-02-28T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 105000000, "id": "P133184", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "LX", "name": "Energy and mining"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "docty": "Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 91, "Name": "Transmission and Distribution of Electricity"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "ZM", "sector2": {"Percent": 9, "Name": "Public administration- Energy and mining"}, "totalamt": 105000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "2", "name": ""}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-05-30T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Zambia", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Republic of Zambia!$!ZM", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The objective of the Electricity Transmission and Distribution System Rehabilitation Project for Zambia is to increase the capacity and improve the reliability of the electricity transmission and distribution system in the Lusaka area.

(1) Extension of electricity transmission and distribution systems component will provide access to electricity to about 10,300 new users located not only in Monrovia but also outside of the capital, along the corridor to the town of Kakata. In addition, the transmission line along the corridor will have the capacity to connect around other 6,000 new consumers if additional financing becomes available. (2) Construction of facilities for off-loading, transport, and storage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and support for optimization of HFO procurement component will support the government's decision to replace current expensive diesel-based generation with less costly HFO-based thermal generation. There are both physical and commercial aspects to optimizing the supply of fuel. Firstly, more reliable HFO supply will require physical investments in HFO off-loading, transport and storage facilities. Secondly, it requires improving HFO procurement practices. (3) Support for the expansion of supply options and for the strengthening of the sector's institutional capacity component will support the overall strengthening of Ministry of Lands, Mines and

Arab Spring has also reached Morocco, although its experience has been a reasonably peaceful one with social demonstrations taking place regularly across the country during 2011 and only sporadic outbursts of violence noted. This social movement started with calls for political change, a curbing of corruption and a more inclusive development process. In March 2011, the King of Morocco proposed a broad and comprehensive package of political reforms that were approved in a constitutional referendum held on July 1, 2011. The new constitution sets the basis for a more open and democratic society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state of law and institutions, and lays the foundation for extended regionalization. These changes have followed on the heels of other reforms already undertaken since the current King came to power. Successive national governments have overseen an impressive political, economic and social transformation, with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s when a series of adverse external shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial crisis. However, as shown, none of these factors provided total immunity to the rising tide of dissatisfaction and to the pressure from the outstanding development issues and challenges. The program aims to strengthen the schools sector's institutional arrangements in the short term, in ways that in the medium term will: (i) increase access to school education, especially for rural girls and boys at the lower secondary level; (ii) improve the quality of teaching and learning in primary and lower secondary education; and (iii) enhance efficiency in decentralized governance of the

It will promote the participation of women by selecting activities that are supportive of women employment and reserving a percentage of the LIPW jobs specifically for women. This component will also (with third component) support the mainstreaming of LIPWs into national policies, strategies and procedures and the establishment of a permanent capacity for LIPWs in the country. The second component is skills development. This component aims to improve youth employability by offering youth with different skills levels within their first training experience. This component has following three sub-components: (1) development of initial vocational training through a dual training approach for economic sectors (sub-component 2-1 A) and establishment of a demand driven training system and provision of training (sub-component 2-1 B); (2) apprenticeship program; and (3) entrepreneurship training and provision of follow up support to entrepreneurs. The third component is institutional capacity strengthening and project management.

This component will finance NHB to refinance, directly or indirectly through qualified intermediary institutions, low-income housing loans made by QPLIs to primary borrowers to purchase, build or upgrade their dwelling. NHB has recently prepared a refinancing scheme for secured low-income housing loans to borrowers with formal and informal incomes. NHB will develop guidelines (to be formulated and reflected in the project\u0092s operations manual) for the provision of alternatively secured housing loans to formal and informal borrowers. The third component is project implementation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be set up within NHB to help implement the project, carry out monitoring and evaluation, be responsible for legal issues and grievance redressal, overseeing and monitoring the social and environmental due diligence (including conducting annual third party audits of QPLIs), keeping the project\u0092s operations manual updated, and financial management and carry out any procurement necessary under the project. Low-income housing expertise will also be added to the PIU to provide technical inputs to the procurement of consultants\u0092 services under component one. External communications on the project will also be covered by NHB staff. Lastly, NHB will also take on responsibility for dissemination and communication activities under its own budget, such as conferences or workshops."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate":

The project could trigger additional financing from donors by demonstrating practical ways to apply progressive policy at the local level, the project will open the way for other donors and for Ministry of Education (MoE) to fund the integration of children with disabilities in further hub schools."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "07-OCT-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081f65e20_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081f65e20_1_0", "DocType": "ISRR", "DocTypeDesc": "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "25-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130510115002", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130510115002", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "13-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130510115452", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130510115452", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "01-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000356161_20130423112049", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130423112049", "DocType": "PJPR", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 2860000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Education for all"}, "grantamt": 2860000, "themecode": "89,65", "borrower": "MOLDOVA SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND", "sectorcode": "EZ,JB", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 80, "Name": "Health and other social services"}, {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Education"}], "board_approval_month": "May", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "65", "name": "Education for all"}, {"code": "89", "name": "Injuries and non-communicable diseases"}], "countryname": "Republic of Moldova", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P144618/integration-children-disabilities-mainstream-schools?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "JB", "name": "Other social services"}, {"code": "EZ", "name": "General education sector"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c845"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Sub-national government administration"}, {"Name": "Central government administration"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Public sector governance", "Public sector governance", "Public sector governance", "Social dev/gender/inclusion", "Public sector governance"], "idacommamt": 50000000, "project_name": "Quality of Decentralized Service Delivery Support Development Policy Operation", "mjthemecode": "2,2,2,7,2", "closingdate": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 50000000, "id": "P145114", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "docty": "Summary of Discussion,Program Document,Program Information Document,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 70, "Name": "Sub-national government administration"}, "lendinginstr": "Development Policy Lending", "countrycode": "RW", "sector2": {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Central government administration"}, "totalamt": 50000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "2", "name": "Public sector governance"}, {"code": "2", "name": "Public sector governance"}, {"code": "2", "name": "Public sector governance"}, {"code": "7", "name": "Social dev/gender/inclusion"}, {"code": "2", "name": "Public sector governance"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-05-14T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Rwanda", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Closed", "country_namecode": "Republic of Rwanda!$!RW", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The Quality of Decentralized Service Delivery Support Development Policy Operation Program development objective for Rwanda is to support the Government to clarify institutional roles and responsibilities for decentralized service delivery and to enhance public transparency, fiduciary accountability, and local government capacity for improved access to quality services. The design of this operation has benefited from close collaboration with the Government, development partners, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and various stakeholders. This operation builds on the decentralization and public sector reforms supported by previous and ongoing World Bank operations. It targets key medium term challenges to improving the quality of service delivery to Rwandan citizens. In recognition of the limited citizen participation and ownership of the development process, the Government has identified the decentralization process as the key focus for its accountable governance reforms. The Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances and a fluid aid environment. The financing provided through this operation will help the Government maintain public expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are relevant for poverty reduction. In addition, while a lack of financial resources may also reduce the Government's ability to implement planned reforms, this operation will help the Government maintain momentum in important reform areas such as capacity building, public financial management (PFM) and social accountability."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "14-MAY-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20130517100007", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130517100007", "DocType": "Summary of Discussion", "DocTypeDesc": "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "19-APR-2013", "EntityID": "000356161_20130425121507", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130425121507", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "01-APR-2013", "EntityID": "000001843_20130418094315", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130418094315", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "16-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000001843_20130320150947", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130320150947", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 50000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 5, "Name": "Administrative and civil service reform"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "26,57,27,30,25", "borrower": "MINECOFIN", "sectorcode": "BC,BH", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 70, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "board_approval_month": "May", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "25", "name": "Administrative and civil service reform"}, {"code": "30", "name": "Other public sector governance"}, {"code": "27", "name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}, {"code": "57", "name": "Participation and civic engagement"}, {"code": "26", "name": "Decentralization"}], "countryname": "Republic of Rwanda", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P145114/quality-decentralized-service-delivery-support-development-policy-operation?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Closed", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "BH", "name": "Sub-national government administration"}, {"code": "BC", "name": "Central government administration"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c846"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "SME Finance"}, {"Name": "General industry and trade sector"}, {"Name": "General public administration sector"}, {"Name": "Health"}, {"Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Financial and private sector development", "Trade and integration"], "idacommamt": 55000000, "impagency": "MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT", "project_name": "Vietnam Inclusive Innovation Project", "mjthemecode": "4,5", "closingdate": "2018-11-30T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 55000000, "id": "P121643", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "FX", "name": "Finance"}, {"code": "YX", "name": "Industry and trade"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"code": "JX", "name": "Health and other social services"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "docty": "Implementation Status and Results Report,Disbursement Letter,Financing Agreement,Project Agreement,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Agreement,Project Information Document,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet", "sector1": {"Percent": 45, "Name": "SME Finance"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "VN", "sector2": {"Percent": 28, "Name": "General industry and trade sector"}, "totalamt": 55000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "4", "name": "Financial and private sector development"}, {"code": "5", "name": "Trade and integration"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-05-13T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Vietnam", "sector4": {"Percent": 5, "Name": "Health"}, "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "East Asia and Pacific", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The development objective of the Inclusive Innovation Project for Vietnam is to adopt, upgrade and develop inclusive innovations for the benefit of the Base of Pyramid population.(BoP).

Improvement Project for Georgia are: (i) to contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and to improve road safety along the section upgraded under the project; and (ii) to strengthen the capacity of the Roads Department (RD) and the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) to plan and manage the road network and improve road traffic safety. The project has four components. The first component is improvement and asset management of the East-West highway. It has following five sub-components: (i) upgrading of existing East-West highway through the construction of a 2-lane dual carriageway from Agara to Zemo Osiauri; (ii) maintenance of the E60 2-lane dual carriageway between Natakhtari and Ruisi; (iii) civil works to improve road safety and access roads on the existing East-West highway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (67km) and along the existing E60 alignment between Ruisi and Chumateleti (44km); (iv) environmental improvement measures along completed sections of the E60 highway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (67km); and (v) construction supervision and quality assurance services. The second component is institutional strengthening. This component provides for the financing of activities to further deepen institutional strengthening efforts being carried out under ongoing bank supported projects. The activities are as follows: (a) institutional strengthening of the MRDI to help the following activities: review and updating of road sector strategy, support to the MRDI to improve road safety management capacity, support to the MRDI to improve the operating environment for the local construction industry, and measures to improve manpower planning and development in MRDI; (b) institutional strengthening of the RD to help organizational efficiency improvement and manpower planning and development measures, and development of a strategic roadmap for the development and implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) along the East West highway corridor, from Tbilisi to Turkish border. The third component is preparation of designs and supporting studies for future projects for the development of the East-West highway. This component will finance activities for the definition and design of civil works included in component A of the proposed project and preparatory studies for the future westward upgrading of the E60. The planned activities include: (1) study to define the scope of the maintenance interventions along some upgraded sections of the E60 2-lane dual carriageway e.g. Natakhtari to Ruisi (67 kilometers); (2) road safety improvement studies and designs; (3) update of feasibility studies and undertaking of preliminary engineering design of new Rikoti tunnel and 60km of highway between Chumateleti and Argveta; and (4) detailed design of the new tunnel at Rikoti, preparation of bidding documents and independent review of all technical and safety provisions.

increase access and equity in primary education; (b) improve learning conditions in primary education; and (c) strengthen sector management and promote greater accountability by introducing new management practices at the local levels. The project has three components. The first component is increasing access and equity at the primary level through rehabilitation and re-construction of classrooms. The objectives of this component are to: (i) rehabilitate or replace classrooms in disrepair and those built with non-durable materials (mud and straws and leaves); (ii) add or rehabilitate school director offices and annexed facilities such as latrines and water supply; and (iii) involve local communities, specifically the Conseils de gestion scolaire (COGES) in the provision and management of school infrastructures and furniture. The second component is improving the quality of the learning environment. This will support the teacher skills development in Equator and Kasai-West, and the provision of textbooks and pedagogical materials country-wide. This component has following two sub-components: (a) strengthening in-service training to improve teacher quality given the erosion of teacher training capacity through the crisis period; and (b) provision of learning materials, as planned in the Interim Education Plan (IEP), support the acquisition and the distribution of textbooks, country-wide to all public and private primary education schools. The third component is strengthening sector management. This component will support interventions to ensure that current regulations are applied and strengthened as a basis for more efficient and more accountable sector management. It has following three sub-components: (i) restructuring of the education administrative offices. This sub-component will consist of: (a) provision of operating costs for school management offices (Bureaux Gestionnaires de Proximite); (b) the development of management and reporting tools and communication activities; (c) the design of results-based agreements; and (d) financial audits and quality assessments; (ii) other strengthening of institutional capacity to provide technical assistance to Service de Controle et de la Paie des Enseignants (SECOPE) to implement reform. This technical assistance will cover the 3-year period of the project but will intervene on a periodic basis following a clear work plan; and (iii) project management and coordination. This sub-component will support project management and coordination through the financing of medium-term consultant services and technical assistance in the education sector."}, "approvalfy": "2013",

In the short term, the project will finance cash transfers to increase and smooth food consumption of poor households and improve their ability to cope with shocks, while enhancing and protecting the human capital accumulation of their children. In parallel, the project will help to start setting-up parameters of an effective national safety net system which in the medium-and long-term could protect households in absence of shocks but could also be scaled-up in times of crisis. Some of the lessons learned includes: (i) a strong institutional framework for social protection policy is necessary for setting-up a safety net system; (ii) sustainable strategies to support chronically food-insecure households require among others, regular cash transfers for periods of at least between 24 to 36 months; (iii) rigorous Management Information System (MIS) can inform strategic decision-making; and (iv) good targeting is necessary to provide support to those who are most in need."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "30-APR-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130506142917", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130506142917", "DocType": "Summary of Discussion", "DocTypeDesc": "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "19-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000356161_20130321143429", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130321143429", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "18-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000445729_20130327100415", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130327100415", "DocType": "PJPR", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "19-NOV-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20121203163558", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121203163558", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "06-JAN-2012", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2012010614082991", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012010614082991", "DocType": "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "22-DEC-2011", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2011122212432675", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122212432675", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}], "lendprojectcost": 70000000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 75, "Name": "Social safety nets"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "55,68,70,54", "borrower": "GOVERNMENT OF MALI", "sectorcode": "JB", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 100, "Name": "Health and other social services"}], "board_approval_month": "April", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "54", "name": "Social safety nets"}, {"code": "70", "name": "Other human development"}, {"code": "68", "name": "Nutrition and food security"}, {"code": "55", "name": "Vulnerability assessment and monitoring"}], "countryname": "Republic of Mali", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P127328/mali-social-protection-employment-project-spep?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "JB", "name": "Other social services"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c859"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Secondary education"}, {"Name": "Primary education"}, {"Name": "Tertiary education"}, {"Name": "Public administration- Education"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Human development", "Human development"], "idacommamt": 10000000, "impagency": "MINISTRY OF EDUCATION", "project_name": "Enhancing Education Development Project", "mjthemecode": "8,8", "closingdate": "2018-06-30T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 10000000, "id": "P131331", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "EX", "name": "Education"}, {"code": "EX", "name": "Education"}, {"code": "EX", "name": "Education"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "docty": "Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Financing Agreement,Disbursement Letter,Project Appraisal Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 50, "Name": "Secondary education"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "MV", "sector2": {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Primary education"}, "totalamt": 10000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "8", "name": "Human development"}, {"code": "8", "name": "Human development"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Maldives", "sector4": {"Percent": 5, "Name": "Public administration- Education"}, "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "South Asia", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Republic of Maldives!$!MV", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The development objective of the Enhancing Education Development Project (EEDP) for Maldives is to enhance and strengthen strategic dimensions of education access and quality.

The sub-components will dovetail the almost complete support provided by the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) to renovate, refurbish and equip health centers, including reinstating adequate provisions for waiting shelters for expecting mothers. Building on infrastructure improvement supported by MCA, the project will contribute to the supply-side improvements which are fundamental to strengthen the quality and utilization of health services. (2) Training of health professionals and Village Health Workers (VHWs) and improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity component will be solely financed through IDA financing and have two subcomponents. (2A) Training health professionals and VHWs will support an ongoing MOH program for training doctors, nurse anesthetists and midwives to achieve an acceptable standard of competency in the delivery of MNH.

Over the past 18 months the Government has implemented difficult reforms at the port of Cotonou, has proceeded with meaningful anticorruption efforts, has made progress in strengthening public financial management, public procurement processes in particular, civil service reform has accelerated, and important steps have been taken in improving the business enabling environment. Some of these efforts were met by stiff resistance, and implementation is proving difficult. The Government has nonetheless demonstrated considerable resolve in proceeding with this reform agenda.

There are no new safeguard or fiduciary issues applicable to the additional financing (AF), which will use the same environmental and social management framework as the original project, updated in 2011. In terms of outcomes, the AF will support the preparation and implementation of more than 1,000 additional plans benefiting 31,600 additional families, compared to about 1,500 plans and 53,600 families under the original project, bringing the cumulative totals to about 2,500 plans and more than 85,000 beneficiary families.

Policy Loan Project for Panama is to support the Government of Panama in creating fiscal space and strengthening social transfer programs. The operation supports four areas that are central to the Government's reform program: (1) tax reform will support the Government's tax policy and administration reforms and its improvements in international tax information sharing. Together, these reforms are expected to mobilize tax revenue and facilitate the international exchange of tax information; (2) modernizing public procurement practices will significantly increase accountability and transparency and reduce transaction costs, since 37 percent of non-financial sector public spending is done through procurement; (3) increasing the efficiency of debt management; a major challenge for debt management in Panama is the lack of a medium-term debt management strategy. In particular, while overall guidelines such as the development of the domestic debt market and the smoothing of the debt profile exist, there is no formal debt management strategy in place. Such a strategy will establish target ranges for selected indicators of financial risk after assessing the cost-risk tradeoffs of different alternatives; and (4) and expanding and improving targeting

that have reduced hydropower generation capacity; and (b) insufficient development of new generation capacity relative to the growing demand for electricity. The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has begun to implement a strategy to place the power sector on a more sustainable path. The discovery of important offshore natural gas reserves presents Tanzania with a potentially transformational opportunity for the country. The Government is determined to, and has started the process of, implementing an appropriate policy framework for the optimal use of future natural gas revenues. A programmatic approach is being proposed to support the Government in addressing the above challenges. The operation is consistent with the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY12-15 and the Africa regional strategy. The development objective of the program is to: (i) strengthen the country's ability to bridge the financial gap in its power sector; (ii) reduce the cost of power supply and to promote private sector participation in the power sector; and (iii) to strengthen the policy and institutional framework for the management of the country's natural gas resources."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "26-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000445729_20130401110751", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130401110751", "DocType": "Summary of Discussion", "DocTypeDesc": "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "26-FEB-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130308121240", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130308121240", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "28-JAN-2013", "EntityID": "000001843_20130225170645", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130225170645", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 100000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 29, "Name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "39,38,27", "borrower": "MINISTRY OF FINANCE", "sectorcode": "LC,LZ", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 57, "Name": "Energy and mining"}, {"Percent": 43, "Name": "Energy and mining"}], "board_approval_month": "March", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "27", "name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}, {"code": "38", "name": "Corporate governance"}, {"code": "39", "name": "Infrastructure services for private sector development"}], "countryname": "United Republic of Tanzania", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143645/tz-first-power-gas-dpo?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Closed", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "LZ", "name": "General energy sector"}, {"code": "LC", "name": "Oil and gas"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c88f"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Other social services"}, {"Name": "Public administration- Other social services"}, {"Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Social protection and risk management", "Social dev/gender/inclusion", "Social protection and risk management"], "idacommamt": 50000000, "project_name": "Cameroon Social Safety Nets", "mjthemecode": "6,7,6", "closingdate": "2018-08-31T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 50000000, "id": "P128534", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "JX", "name": "Health and other social services"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "docty": "Indigenous Peoples Plan,Project Appraisal Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Resettlement Plan,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Other Social Protection Study,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 78, "Name": "Other social services"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "CM", "sector2": {"Percent": 16, "Name": "Public administration- Other social services"}, "totalamt": 50000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "6", "name": "Social protection and risk management"}, {"code": "7", "name": "Social dev/gender/inclusion"}, {"code": "6", "name": "Social protection and risk management"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-03-21T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Cameroon", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Republic of Cameroon!$!CM", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The development objective of the Social Safety Net Project for Cameroon is to support the establishment of a basic national safety net system including piloting targeted cash transfers and public works programs for the poorest and most vulnerable people in participating areas within the Recipient\u0092s territory.

The second component is the pilot cash transfer program with accompanying measures to boost household productivity (US$36.3 million). This component is for supporting the development and to boost the productivity of chronically poor households and serve as the cornerstone of Cameroon\u0092s social safety net. Accompanying measures are to be developed to maximize the impact of the cash transfers on the welfare and productivity of beneficiary households. The third component is the public works program pilot (US$5.9 million).

The programmatic series supports poverty reduction through higher growth, stronger governance, and greater economic resilience. The series is structured in three pillars: 1) building private-sector growth and generating employment; 2) improving governance and public resource management; and 3) increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability. Overall long-term growth projections remain positive but dependent on commodity shocks and on public investment efficiency, while inclusive growth will depend on the economy's ability for structural transformation. Overall, Burkina Faso's macroeconomic framework is judged to be appropriate.

Similar to the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model adopted by the central government as a key market mechanism to scale up energy efficiency investments, the RESCO will take the performance and financial risk of the investment by signing an energy service performance contract (ESPC) with each school and university, which will pay the RESCO only for the solar PV electricity it consumes. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the RESCO by the Beijing municipality; and (2) technical assistance (TA) for developing local capacity for scaling up solar energy deployment, project implementation, and other priority energy policy initiatives of the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG). TA activities include: (i) demonstration of the RESCO model for large-scale grid-connected rooftop solar PV deployment in Beijing municipality, provision of engineering and technical support in relation to PV systems to Yuanshen Company, and independent monitoring and evaluation of implementation and results of such model; (ii) demonstration of two-way metering in Beijing municipality; (iii) establishment of an online monitoring system for rooftop PV systems and a solar energy information portal in Beijing municipality; and (iv) improvement of renewable energy education in schools and other educational institutions in Beijing municipality."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "10-JUL-2013", "EntityID": "090224b082036295_1_0", "DocURL":

"The higher-level global environment objective of the Green Energy for Low-Carbon City Project in Shanghai Project for China is to support Shanghai's low-carbon city development by promoting green energy schemes, with a focus on Changning district. The project has two components: a) a technical assistance and incremental support for near zero-emission buildings component funded by a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant; and b) a low carbon investments component funded by an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan.

(DPO) is a new series of three DPOs (FY13-15). The EMCC proposes to support economic management reforms to enhance competitiveness for sustained growth and poverty reduction. The EMCC will focus specifically on three elements of competitiveness: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) transparency, efficiency and accountability of the public sector; and (iii) an enabling business environment that promotes private sector development. The operation will also look at two cross-cutting themes: (a) protecting the poor from adverse effects of Vietnam's economic transition and competitiveness-related reforms; and (b) promoting greater data and policymaking transparency. Analytical work and policy dialogue will aim to ensure that these cross-cutting issues are appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported under the operation.

Without immediate support to affected farmers the livestock sub-sector will be under significant risk for destocking and loss of capital, with potential long-term negative consequences. The project will help to reduce the risk of destocking by providing conditional cash transfers and technical assistance (awareness and training) to farmers in the most affected districts, so as to maintain their ability to plant spring crops, and particularly corn and wheat.

The operation complements the Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF) series which supports the policy and institutional actions that are focused on promoting inclusive growth, economic transformation and good governance. In January 2011, the Government approved a National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) that aims to establish a comprehensive and integrated SP system. The overall objective of the NSPS is to 'build a social protection system that tackles poverty and inequality, enables the poor to move out of poverty, helps reduce vulnerability and protect people from shocks, helps improve health and education among all Rwandans, and contributes to economic growth.' The SSPS-2 will help the Government of Rwanda (GoR) implement its NSPS, building on the Bank's support to the SP sector in Rwanda over the last six years that started with the Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP) and the Community Living Standards Grant/Credit (CLSG/C)."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "14-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "000333037_20130327111746", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130327111746", "DocType": "Summary of Discussion", "DocTypeDesc": "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "19-FEB-2013", "EntityID": "000356161_20130222114621", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130222114621", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "08-FEB-2013", "EntityID": "000001843_20130214092959", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130214092959", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "01-NOV-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20121107133728", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121107133728", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 50000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 10, "Name": "Gender"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "53,54,55,52,59", "borrower": "REPUBLIC OF RWANDA, MINECOFIN", "sectorcode": "JB", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 100, "Name": "Health and other social services"}], "board_approval_month": "March", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "59", "name": "Gender"}, {"code": "52", "name": "Natural disaster management"}, {"code": "55", "name": "Vulnerability assessment and monitoring"}, {"code": "54", "name": "Social safety nets"}, {"code": "53", "name": "Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring"}], "countryname": "Republic of Rwanda", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131666/rwanda-second-support-social-protection-system?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "JB", "name": "Other social services"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c8a2"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Forestry"}, {"Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, {"Name": "Crops"}, {"Name": "Animal production"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Environment and natural resources management", "Rural development"], "idacommamt": 2000000, "impagency": "GENERAL DIRECTION OF FOREST AND NATURAL RESOURCES (DGFRN)", "project_name": "BJ-Forest & Adjacent Land Mgmt Addit Fin", "mjthemecode": "11,10", "closingdate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 2000000, "id": "P132431", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "docty": "Implementation Status and Results Report,Project Paper,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet", "sector1": {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Forestry"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "BJ", "sector2": {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, "totalamt": 2000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "11", "name": "Environment and natural resources management"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2013-03-14T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Benin", "sector4": {"Percent": 25, "Name": "Animal production"}, "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Republic of Benin!$!BJ", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The objective of the Additional Financing for the Forests and Adjacent Lands Management (FALM) Project for Benin is to assist the recipient in its effort to lay the foundation for a collective integrated ecosystem management system for its forests and adjacent lands.

The Lines of Credits will provide Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFI) loans to eligible PFIs for the purposes of on-lending as sub-loans to eligible beneficiaries or Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) for the carrying out of sub-projects. The operation will enhance the role of financial institutions in economic growth through financing and developing the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector in Jordan. A special focus would be placed on providing increased long and medium-term financing for these enterprises' investment. The operation will comprise a line of credit channeled through the Central Bank of Jordan to banks that either have an active MSME portfolio or the willingness and capacity to develop one. The banks will then on-lend the funding directly to micro and small enterprises or MFIs that will on-lend to MSMEs. The participating banks could be incentivized through various mechanisms such as tenor, having access to training and capacity building under the MSME Regional Technical Assistance (TA) Facility and through enhanced amounts, in case the lending proposals support on-lending to those market segments that face the biggest market failures, such as lending to viable MSMEs in remote areas."},

Financing is needed for implementation of the basic package of health services (BPHS) and essential package of hospital services (EPHS) through contracting out and contracting in arrangements both in rural and urban areas in provinces supported by the European union (EU), the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and the World Bank, covering a total of twenty one provinces in the country (out of thirty four provinces). System enhancement for health action in transition (SEHAT) will be a platform nation-wide project, which will allow for financing health services in more provinces if additional resources become available. The project will also strengthen the national health system and ministry of public health's capacity at central and provincial levels, so it can effectively perform its stewardship functions in the

objective of the Additional Financing for the Electricity Access Scale-up and Sector-wide Approach Development Project for Rwanda is to improve access to reliable and cost effective electricity services for households and priority public institutions. The additional credit will help to scale-up ongoing activities related to expansion of access and productive use of electricity, contributing to the project's development impact for households and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The Additional Financing (AF) will support connecting an additional 48,000 households to the electricity grid as part of the second phase of the Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP). In addition, the AF will support scaling up of 'green connections' associated with energy efficient solutions; increased uptake of solar products such as solar water heaters and solar photo-voltaic systems; low-cost products such as ready-boards to make it affordable for low-income households to get connected to the electricity grid; and productive uses of electricity to promote increased use of electricity by SMEs. The additional activities have been estimated to be implemented in a timeframe of about 3 1/2 years. Therefore an extension of the closing date of the original credit to June 30, 2016, is required and is within three years of the closing date of the original credit."}, "approvalfy": "2013",

Development Policy Loan Program for Morocco is to support the Government's efforts to improve the economic, environmental, and social performance of the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) sector. This program document presents a Third MSW Development Policy Loan (DPL 3) to the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of Euro 100 million (US$ 130 million equivalent). This new series builds on the excellent sectoral dialogue with the Government, the overall success of the previous two operations and the need to consolidate medium-term reforms. It will be implemented in parallel with the second phase (2013-2017) of the Government's ongoing 15-year National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and will support its transition to full implementation and roll-out, while focusing on the overall coherence of the sector with the new decentralization agenda. In this context, the programmatic series aims to support the Government's efforts to improve the economic, environmental and social performance of the MSW sector. The measures supported by this DPL focus on: 1) strengthening governance, particularly demand-side governance, in the sector by improving accountability, transparency, and access to information, and by providing citizens and civil society with new and effective opportunities for engagement and voice; 2) anchoring long-term institutional and financial sustainability of the sector in line with the new decentralization agenda; 3) upgrading the country's environmental monitoring and control system; and 4) developing a financially viable and socially inclusive waste recycling sector. Finally the program is implemented in close collaboration with other partners."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "07-JUN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081c3e08a_1_0", "DocURL":

the Climate Resilient Participatory Afforestation and Reforestation Project for Bangladesh is to reduce forest degradation and increase forest coverage through participatory planning and monitoring and to contribute in building the long-term resilience of selected communities in coastal and hilly areas to climate change. The project has four components. The first component is afforestation and reforestation program. The objective of this component is to increase the afforested and reforested areas through participatory forestry and co-management approach in the degraded forestland, marginal, fallow and newly accreted land in coastal and hilly areas.  In achieving the target of participatory afforestation and reforestation, the component will also support the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the existing field offices of the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD). The second component is alternative livelihoods to support forest communities. The objective of this component is to improve and diversify non forest-based livelihood opportunities of poor forest dependent households in selected forest communities. This component will target 6,000 households comprising no less than 25,000 people in 200 forest communities in 9 project districts with a clear and sound selection method. The third component is capacity development for forest resource planning and management. The objective of the component is to improve the technical knowledge base on forest resource assessment, program monitoring and long-term planning for the sustainable development of the forest sector. The fourth component is project management. This component will support the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in BFD for implementation of component one and three. The PIU will provide necessary support for financial management, social and environmental safeguards, communication and procurement to Arannayk Foundation (AF)."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs":

There are three components to the project, the first component being Improving Climate Resilience of the WCR. This component will implement measures to strengthen the climate resilience of the economically critical WCR, which is a key Government of Samoa (GoS) objective under the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). Works will improve the road pavement between Vailoa junction in Apia and Faleolo International Airport (approximately 26 km) by raising and strengthening vulnerable sections of the WCR, sealing shoulders, and improving longitudinal and cross drainage. The second component is the vulnerability assessment of the Samoa road network. This component involves technical assistance that will directly support the SPCR by bringing about transformative change in the way that climate change is addressed in the Samoa roads sector. Finally, the third component is the project management and operating costs. This component will also provide funding for specific inter-project SPCR coordination activities, such as: (a) knowledge exchange and lessons learned to feed into the coordination of the SPCR at a programmatic level; (b) resources for GoS officials to participate and contribute to overall SPCR processes; and (c) monitoring and evaluating project results."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs":

objective of the Lifeline Road Network Improvement Project for Armenia is to improve access of rural communities to markets and services through upgrading of selected lifeline roads, and to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MoTC) to manage the lifeline road network. The project has two components. (1) Lifeline road improvement component will finance the improvement (rehabilitation and/or upgrading) of an estimated 170 km of lifeline roads. The first year program was identified during the project preparation. Around 72 km (seven road segments) will be improved (including a 23 km corridor where a pilot on rehabilitation and maintenance is going to be implemented). The remaining 98 km will be identified during the implementation. Detailed designs for those roads, as well as supervision of civil works are also included under this component. (2) Project management and institutional strengthening component aims at helping strengthening capabilities within the MoTC on issues related to road assets management, road safety, performance based contracts, road sector financing,  sustainability, and social monitoring. It will finance technical assistance, equipment, and operational costs associated with the implementation of the project. It will also finance studies required for the preparation of potential future investments in the road sector."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "02-SEP-2013", "EntityID":

for Uzbekistan are to: (i) promote the introduction of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies of relevance to agribusinesses and farms; and (ii) strengthen capacity for improving degraded irrigated land and water conservation in the project area. There are three components to the project, the first component being promoting renewable energy technologies. This component will include the following activities: (i) support the dissemination of knowledge and information on renewable energy technologies (including, inter alia, bio-gas digesters, solar water heaters, and solar photovoltaic and biomass installations) by provision of goods, works and training for demonstration purposes in selected districts; and (ii) provision of support to beneficiaries for the carrying out of renewable energy subprojects. The second component is the promoting technologies and practices to mitigate irrigated land degradation. Activities under this component will aim at introducing technologies and management approaches for controlling and reversing irrigated land degradation. This includes the introduction, testing and demonstration of integrated low-cost, low-risk water and land management technologies, such as drip irrigation, salinity mitigation of marginal land, water re-use, soil quality enhancement, pumping for groundwater extraction, alternative cropping, and other techniques and practices to increase water use efficiency and agricultural productivity. Finally, the third component is the advisory services and project management."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "28-DEC-2012", "EntityID": "000333037_20130115163145", "DocURL":

Reengagement and Reform Support Credit Program for Myanmar are (i) to support Myanmar's critical reforms for strengthening macroeconomic stability, improving public financial management, and improving the investment climate, which will in turn help grow the economy, create jobs, and reduce poverty; and (ii) to facilitate the clearance of Myanmar's arrears to International Development Association (IDA), which is required in order to restore normal relations between Myanmar and the World Bank. This program document states a Reengagement and Reform Support Credit (RRSC) to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for SDR287.75 (US$440 million equivalent). It will be a standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed at supporting the full normalization of relations between Myanmar and the World Bank as well as the Government's efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy reforms in the implementation of its medium-term development strategy. In terms of IDA resources, Myanmar is eligible for exceptional support as a reengaging country. Since Myanmar is projected to be at a low risk of debt distress after arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit terms, per the stipulations of the credit allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period (FY12-FY14). Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge will be to ensure that these reforms translate into improved living standards for the majority of the population, and that gains registered are sustained. The program document is divided into six sections, including this introduction. Second section discusses the country context which gives an overview of Myanmar focusing on the political and economic context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Third section presents the Myanmar Government's development program; fourth section discusses how the Bank is supporting the government's program, while section fifth describes the DPO. Sixth section outlines implementation issues, including risks and mitigating measures."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "22-JAN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0818bbd3d_1_0", "DocURL":

ecological forest plantations in Hunan Province by increasing forest species diversity and vegetative tree cover in those areas. There are two components to the project, the first component being reforestation and rehabilitation of damaged ecological forest plantations. These newly reforested and rehabilitated areas are expected to be developed into multi-storied vegetation communities of uneven-aged stands with a mixture of tree species. Forests developed in this landscape would contribute to a stable forest ecosystem that can be tolerant of future disturbances and change, including those caused by climate change. The long-term management of these forest stands will also promote their sustainability. Finally, the second component is the two-institutional support and technology enhancement. This component includes: nursery upgrading and planting material development, forest cooperatives, research, technical service and extension, project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and project

The project's immediate beneficiaries are primary school going children belonging to disadvantaged groups in 20 priority provinces. The project also seeks to indirectly benefit a larger number of children by helping to bring about a system-wide transformation through pedagogical innovation. The GPE-VNEN project is a set of sequential activities that together constitute a comprehensive package of pedagogical and administrative reform. The project comprises four components: (1) Material development for pedagogical renovation, which includes the development of learning guides and other materials and capacity building for material development; (2) training and provision of materials; (3) school level support for VNEN implementation; and (4) project and knowledge management.

objective of the Integrated Disaster and Land Management Project for Togo is to strengthen institutional capacity of targeted institutions to manage risk of flooding and land degradation in targeted rural and urban areas. There are four components to the project. The first component is institutional strengthening and awareness rising. This component supports institutional strengthening: capacity of key national, regional, local, and community organizations engaged in disaster risk and sustainable land management (DRM and SLM) will be strengthened through the provision of equipment and training; and awareness rising: awareness about the risks of flooding and land degradation will be enhanced through targeted information campaigns at national and local levels. The second component is community-based activities for adaptation and sustainable land management. this component supports community-based activities in watershed and flood-prone areas: resilience to flooding will be strengthened through targeted pilot activities at the local level that will enable communities to better manage disaster risk and land degradation; community-based activities in cropland and grazing land; community-based sustainable forest and wetland management: communities will be assisted in preparing sustainable financing plans and in designing small income generation activities in and around select protected areas and forests to reduce pressure on forest resources and restore ecosystem services. The third component is early warning, monitoring, and knowledge systems. This component supports Early Warning System (EWS): A nation-wide EWS will be developed to alert communities of upcoming possible flood events and allow them to take appropriate actions to protect lives and property, through enhanced collaboration and communications between the national hydro meteorological services and the Togolese Red Cross; and environmental monitoring. The fourth component is project management. For the project to be effectively implemented, project management functions including fiduciary management, monitoring and evaluation (M and E), technical supervision, reporting and audits, will be covered under this component."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "09-OCT-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081ffad75_1_0", "DocURL":

The PEPBG will help the FYR Macedonia access international financial markets to address an expected financing gap in 2013. In the current difficult financial environment, a partially-secured financing structure would facilitate FYR Macedonia's access to market funding at a longer tenor and under more favorable terms than would otherwise be possible. Beyond the current turmoil, the PEPBG will help FYR Macedonia preserve continued market access at reasonable terms, expand over the medium-term its name in the international financial market and help the domestic financial market to develop.

"The objective of the Ari Atoll Solid Waste Management (SWM) Project for Maldives is to build technical and human resource capacity to effectively manage solid waste generated in selected inhabited islands of the Ari Atoll, thereby reducing the environmental risks to marine habitats and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project has three components. The first component is development and implementation of an island level integrated SWM system. This component aims to build the institutional capacity of the island councils and communities in the five islands to plan and implement an island level integrated SWM program to minimize the environmental risks to the country's marine and terrestrial assets while reducing GHG emissions. It has following four sub-components: (i) community participation in source segregation of solid waste to create community awareness on the environment and public health implications of poor SWM in the respective islands and solicit community participation for source segregation of household level solid waste; (ii) implementation of an island level recycling and composting program at the Island Waste Management Centers (IWMCs) to finance: (a) the construction of a concrete pad for composting with a drainage system for leachate collection at each of the IWMCs; and (b) training of staff to undertake simple windrow composting at the IWMCs; (iii) institutional capacity building of the island councils and communities for planning and managing an effective island level integrated SWM system; and (iv) development of a strategy to operationalize the European Union (EU)- financed IWMCs in the atolls of the central province. The second component is development of institutional arrangements and implementation of a waste transfer system for off-island disposal of residual solid waste. The objective of this component is to develop an effective, working institutional model to transfer residual waste from the participating islands of Ari Atoll to the Thilafushi island facility and demonstrate the use of this model for residual waste transfer for all central province atolls. The third component is project management. The objective of this component is to establish an effective mechanism for project implementation, including monitoring and reporting of the implementation progress. Implementation support will be provided by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staff posted at the island offices of the five targeted islands for technical oversight and coordination among the participating island councils that will have the primary responsibility for island-level implementation."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "10-OCT-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081f7a620_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081f7a620_1_0", "DocType": "ISRR", "DocTypeDesc": "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "16-NOV-2012", "EntityID": "000442464_20130904100126", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130904100126", "DocType": "PAD", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "17-JUL-2012", "EntityID": "000020953_20120817110030", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120817110030", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "13-JUL-2012", "EntityID": "000020953_20120913094958", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120913094958", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "21-JUN-2012", "EntityID": "000333037_20120810012054", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120810012054", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 1330000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 40, "Name": "Pollution management and environmental health"}, "grantamt": 1330000, "themecode": "81,84", "borrower": "GOVERNMENT OF MALDIVES", "sectorcode": "WB", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 100, "Name": "Water, sanitation and flood protection"}], "board_approval_month": "December", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "84", "name": "Pollution management and environmental health"}, {"code": "81", "name": "Climate change"}], "countryname": "Republic of Maldives", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P130163/maldives-ari-atoll-solid-waste-management-project?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "WB", "name": "Solid waste management"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c8e4"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "General public administration sector"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "OTHER", "prodline": "RE", "mjtheme": ["Economic management", "Economic management"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "STATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN", "project_name": "Azerbaijan -

This program document states a first governance and growth support credit for the Republic of Senegal in the amount of SDR 35.8 million (US$55 million equivalent). This operation is the first of a new series of three Governance and Growth Support Credits (GGSCs), following a series of two Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs IV and V) completed over 2009-2011. The operation supports the recipient's efforts to improve economic governance by strengthening government accountability, public sector performance, and promoting growth through private sector development. Policies and reforms supported by this operation are well aligned with Senegal's National Strategy for Economic and Social Development (SNDES), which the Bank supports. The operation is also fully consistent with the objectives of the Bank's FY13-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), to be presented to the Board in January 2013. The operation is rooted in the World Bank's Africa strategy. The operation is aligned with the first pillar of the Africa strategy employment and growth and emphasizes the governance foundation of that strategy. By helping create fiscal space, it also aims to improve the government's capacity to cope with external shocks the second pillar of the strategy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has slowed to levels not much above the rate of population growth and poverty remains high. The economy has shown little structural change, a continued dependence on remittances to fuel domestic demand, a growing reliance on capital-intensive exports while labor-intensive sectors faltered, and thus little job creation. The economy has suffered from the global slowdown, commodity price shocks and instability in neighboring countries, which has been exacerbated by the weakness of the domestic reform agenda."},

"The development objective of the Third Phase (APL 3) of the Community Based Rural Development Project and Sustainable Land and forestry Management Project for Burkina Faso is to enhance the capacity of rural communities and decentralized institutions for the implementation of local development plans that promote sustainable land and natural resources management and productive investments at commune level. There are five components to the project. The first component is strengthening capacity for decentralized rural development. The first component of Phase 3 aims to enhance local governance and improve local development planning and management by local governments at all levels. It will build on achievements from earlier phases by deepening technical and capacity building for local stakeholders. Under the project, local governments will develop new communal development plans, prepare annual investment plans, and identify local development projects in strategic, holistic and multi-sectoral manner in collaboration with local communities, local communes, and deconcentrated technical services, the private sector and civil society. The second component is implementation of the rural land legislation and enhancement of local dispute resolution mechanisms. With the legal and regulatory framework for land tenure now in place from earlier phases, the component seeks to support the implementation of the land tenure policy and law. This will be pursued through: (i) the establishment and operation of rural land tenure services at commune level, village land tenure commissions, and village conciliation commissions; (ii) land titling operations; (iii) strengthening of capacity of local actors and rural communes to carry out land titling processes efficiently and transparently; and iv) dissemination of the law to increase men, women and illiterates' awareness about their rights, and pave the way for a more gender-balanced access to land. The third component is local and regional investments. Component three will support communes in promoting socio-economic growth and sustainable development through the financing of strategic local development investments, for all the 302 rural communes in the 13 regions. The fourth component is sustainable land and forestry management. This component aims to support restoration and protection of natural resources, forest and biodiversity in the larger ecosystem landscape related to agricultural expansion. It will include natural resource management and protection of select ecosystems beyond the community-based investments of third component and capacity building of first component above. The fifth component is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component's objective is to ensure that the project components and activities will be effectively carried out, coordinated, monitored and regularly evaluated."}, "approvalfy": "2013",

sub-national entities to coordinate and finance the structuring and implementation of regional and metropolitan development initiatives; and (iv) improve the productivity of the system of cities through improved connectivity within the network of cities and between cities and ports to external markets. These reforms are vital to support the system of cities in Colombia, in which cities are able to grow to their highest potential, and be engines for sustainable growth in the country. This programmatic engagement covers a range of financial, knowledge and convening services across multiple sectors including urban development and housing, urban transport, logistics and connectivity, water and sanitation and disaster risk management. The DPL program aims to reflect the multi-sectoral priorities of this programmatic engagement with an organizing focus on improving the sustainability, productivity and inclusiveness of Colombia's urban system. The economy expanded by a solid 5.9 percent in 2011 - one of the best growth performances in the region. Private domestic demand, supported by high consumer and investor confidence and access to cheap credit, led the growth process. On the supply side the expansion was spear-headed by the oil/mining, financial services, and commerce sectors.

development objectives of the Social Inclusion of Development Policy Loan Program for Peru are (i) supporting the institutionalization of the stewardship of the social inclusion agenda under Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIDIS); (ii) laying the foundations for improving the inclusiveness and effectiveness of key social programs implemented by MIDIS; and (iii) developing adequate systems and strategies for targeting, monitoring and evaluation, and overall coordination. The First Development Policy Loan (DPL1) (US$45 million) will be the first of a two-part Social Inclusion DPL series that aims at supporting the social inclusion reform agenda of the Government of Peru (GoP). The first phase of the social inclusion reform program, supported by this DPL1, will focus on the establishment of the new Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) to initiate the social policy reforms under its responsibility. The second phase of the reform, which will focus on the implementation and consolidation of these reforms, is expected to be supported by a second DPL (Social Inclusion DPL2), planned for FY14. The DPL1 is being presented to the Board together with the Social Inclusion Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). The TAL will support the development of the second phase of reforms and, as such, will provide a bridge of technical support between the two DPL operations. Peru has achieved consistent economic growth, declines in poverty and inequality, and improvements in social indicators over the past decade. However, the Government recognizes that many social and income disparities remain pervasive in the country. Despite the prevalence of social programs, they are fragmented and ineffective in providing a coherent and consistent package of support to the poor. The Government has, therefore, announced a Growth with Inclusion plan that mainly aims at: (i) providing equal access to basic services, employment, and social security; and (ii) reducing extreme poverty, with an emphasis on rural poverty. The Government has created MIDIS to spearhead a large part of this agenda with a focus on the reform of social policies and programs."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate":

There are five components to the project. The first component is quality improvement of MIDIS's programs. This component includes: provision of support to design and pilot activities aimed at improving the quality control of MIDIS's programs by: (i) developing user's participation and accountability mechanisms for the MIDIS's programs. First component contributes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) by supporting activities that improve the performance of MIDIS's programs through accountability mechanisms that institutionalize channels for user's feedback; and the development of planning, information, monitoring and evaluation tools for MIDIS's decentralized offices that coordinate the provision of social programs in the territory. Second component is improving knowledge management, information and communication. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that improve the performance of MIDIS's programs and strengthen MIDIS's capacity to monitor social inclusion policy through the implementation of an integrated information platform that includes data from different programs; the interconnectivity of local targeting units that are strengthened with trained staff on information management, monitoring and customer service; and the development of a national communication strategy that includes different approaches for different population groups. Third component is strengthening of MIDIS's capacity on results orientation, monitoring and evaluation. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that strengthen MIDIS's capacity to monitor social inclusion policy 27 through the development of information dashboards to oversee infant malnutrition and development plans; and technical assistance to improve the evaluation of programs processes, potential effects and impacts. Fourth component is strengthening of human resource management and capacity. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that strengthen MIDIS's systems and capacity to improve the performance of MIDIS's programs through the introduction of result-oriented human resources management practices. Fifth component is support to project administration.

objective of the Second Trade Development Facility Project for Lao People's Democratic Republic is to support the implementation of government's trade and integration priorities outlined in the 2012 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, or DTIS roadmap, and in particular to contribute to improved competitiveness and diversification, focusing outside the natural resource sectors. There are three components to the project, the first component being trade facilitation, trade policy, and regulations. This component builds on the success of trade facilitation and trade policy activities under First Trade Development Facility (TDF-1), and will consist of a number of inter-related activities aimed at improving transparency, predictability and lowering associated compliance costs for traders. Trade facilitation activities will focus primarily on improving inter-agency coordination and supporting the adoption of modern risk based approaches to managing regulatory compliance in non-customs agencies, including reform of non-tariff measures. The second component is the diversification and competitiveness.  This component includes a new set of activities aiming to support improved private sector capacity to improve productivity and compete in international markets, focusing on the non natural resources sectors (in particular outside of mining and hydropower). Activities will facilitate the more effective participation of small and medium sized enterprises in the international economy, better skills and labor standards in the manufacturing sector and support to women's economic empowerment. Finally, the third component is the mainstreaming aid for trade. This component will provide for support to the next generation of Lao PDR's 'aid-for-trade' governance framework as part of efforts to move to a full program based approach for trade and private sector development. The project is financed via a multi donor program, including a multi donor trust fund grant with contributions from Australia, the European Union, Germany and Ireland, and a grant from the World

addressing some of the underlying causes of fragility in Comoros. This program document states an Economic Reform Grant, a stand-alone development policy operation (DPO), to the Union of the Comoros. The single tranche DPO, in the amount of SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent), supports the implementation of core reforms in Comoros's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGSP), at a time when the country is aiming at reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC CP) by end 2012. A previous DPO, the Economic Governance Reform Support Grant (EGRSG), in an amount of US$3 million equivalent, was approved by the Board on June 1, 2010 and disbursed in October 2010. In the politically difficult context of the late 2010 elections, slower than expected implementation of reforms and slippage in macroeconomic performance resulted in delays in the preparation of the planned second DPO. Since mid-2011, the authorities have rekindled the reform process, taken steps to bring the budget under control, and shown a renewed commitment to advancing on structural and institutional reforms. The main goal of the operation is to support government-owned reforms in four out of the six axes spelled out in the country's PRGSP, namely (i) axis one, on economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscal policy and public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this operation's focus on the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in core government personnel management systems and stepping up the fight against corruption and fostering transparency in the issuance of fishing licenses and agreements; and (iv) axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security, emphasizing disaster risk management."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "03-AUG-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081da638a_1_0", "DocURL":

The program will support reforms that incentivize productive investment and technology upgrading in the manufacturing, agribusiness and trade logistics sectors; and put in place enabling conditions that can progressively increase labor market flexibility and skills development. The medium-long term objective is to create better job opportunities and increase the economic growth potential. The DPL will support reforms that incentivize investment and technology upgrading in manufacturing, agribusiness and trade logistics. In parallel, the DPL policy actions will lay the groundwork to increase labor market flexibility and the development of job-relevant skills. This operation is an important element of the 2010 country partnership strategy, directly advancing the outcomes under the Competitiveness pillar. The DPL will also contribute to the inclusive growth pillar in regards to improving employability by reducing impediments to hiring and to the green growth pillar in regards to aligning the agriculture sector with European Union (EU) requirements. The operation will contribute to deepening reforms for improved competitiveness, one of the main strategic priorities in the 2012 Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional strategy, particularly by

There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is investment in HCFC-141b consumption reduction in the PU foam sector. This component will make provision of support to foam system houses to modify their production process, in order to provide hydrocarbon pre-blended polyol to enterprises that cannot adopt full-scale hydrocarbon technology. The second component of the project is investment in HCFC production reduction. The funding under this component will be used to compensate HCFC producers for surrendering their production rights in part or in full in order to contribute to the national compliance with the production freeze and 10 percent production reduction in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The third component of the project is technical assistance and policy support. This component will make provision of support to activities related to identification and testing of potential substitutes for HCFCs. The fourth component of the project is project management. This component will make provision of technical assistance to improve the capacity of Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (FECO) and the Project Management Office (PMO) to manage, supervise, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project.

to assist the Government of Indonesia to strengthen the policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation, Information and Communication Technology, or ICT, and trade facilitation. Policy reforms supported by this operation will focus on the following pillars: i) strengthening national coordination and regulation; ii) strengthening intra-island connectivity; iii) improving inter-island connectivity; and iv) improving International connectivity (trade facilitation). The DPL to Indonesia for US$100 million is designed to assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to strengthen the policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation, and ICT and trade facilitation. In developing the operation, the Bank and the Government considered several design alternatives, including the possibility of supporting such reforms through a single multisectoral DPL. The overall focus of the INSTANSI DPL, Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM DPL) is consistent with the World Bank's Development Policy Review (2008), and they are fully aligned with the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR).

Initially focused on supporting the GoI's macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the previous DPL series covered a broad range of reform efforts aimed at improving the investment climate, strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery. Given that the reform agenda is far from finished and an extension of the reforms is needed, the GoI has requested to terminate the ongoing third DPL series (DPLs 7-9) a year earlier and present the INSTANSI DPL as a new, two-year series.

The additional credit will finance costs associated with scaled-up activities under the project. The changes and additional financing activities will remain consistent with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The main reasons for reduced financing were that the project was introducing new concepts and reengaging financially in the agriculture sector and it was felt that a smaller initial investment would be more prudent. The changes to the project are: a) extension of the closing date of the original project; b) revised project development objective to remove the restriction on project districts and scale up the scope of the project; and c) revised targets of outcome indicators to reflect scaling up of investments. This will require an amendment to the financing agreement for the current project.

The operation is the second in a programmatic series of two development policy operations. The operation will be financed by International Development Association (IDA) resources of US$1.8 million and Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is expected to provide associated sector budget support of AUD 5.0 million (US$5.3 million) for the same policy actions and dependent on the Bank's operation being approved. The operation will help the Government of Tonga manage severe economic challenges that have coincided with historic political reforms. It supports a focused program of Government reform priorities in public financial management, fiscal policy, and business environment reforms while providing a vital fiscal buffer in the context of sustained revenue contraction. The series of operations coincide with the term in office of Tonga's first Government to be selected by a majority-elected parliament and provide an opportunity for the Bank to support Tonga at a critical juncture in its development process. The programmatic series of economic recovery operations focuses on three reform areas. Areas of focus reflect Government's concern to support short-term recovery and mitigate continuing impacts of the crisis on the poorest households while maintaining progress against longer-term structural reforms to deal with ongoing fiscal and economic challenges. Areas of focus include: i) strengthening public financial management; ii) strengthening fiscal policy; and iii) promoting structural reforms relating to the business regulatory environment. The first Tonga Economic recovery operation also supported reforms to strengthen social protection. The Second Tonga economic recovery operation will build on the gains achieved to date. In the area of public financial management, priorities reflect the importance of embedding transparency and solid Public Financial Management (PFM) foundations following recent political reforms. Actions in this area include introduction of a treasury single account, publication of in-year budget reports, and the tabling in Parliament of audited Annual Financial Statements of Government. Under fiscal policy, the agenda focuses on strengthening revenue effort to maintain delivery of public services following substantial revenue declines. Actions in this area include policy decisions to introduce small business and natural resource tax regimes and measures to increase transparency of the costs of tax exemptions."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "15-OCT-2012", "EntityID": "000386194_20121026014259", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121026014259", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "28-JUL-2012", "EntityID": "000386194_20121016020335", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121016020335", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "10-MAY-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20120711105344", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120711105344", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 1800000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 43, "Name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "28,39,23,27", "borrower": "KINGDOM OF TONGA", "sectorcode": "AZ,BZ,LZ,BC", "sector3": {"Percent": 14, "Name": "General public administration sector"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 57, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 24, "Name": "Energy and mining"}, {"Percent": 14, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 5, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "board_approval_month": "November", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "27", "name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}, {"code": "23", "name": "Macroeconomic management"}, {"code": "39", "name": "Infrastructure services for private sector development"}, {"code": "28", "name": "Tax policy and administration"}], "countryname": "Kingdom of Tonga", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P130824/tonga-economic-recovery-operation-ii?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Closed", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "BC", "name": "Central government administration"}, {"code": "LZ", "name": "General energy sector"}, {"code": "BZ", "name": "General public administration sector"}, {"code": "AZ", "name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c915"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Other industry"}, {"Name": "Public administration- Industry and trade"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "OTHER", "prodline": "MT", "mjtheme": ["Environment and natural resources management", "Environment and natural resources management"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "MINISTRY OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRNMENT", "project_name": "Vietnam-HCFC Phase-out Project (Phase I)", "mjthemecode": "11,11", "closingdate": "2017-06-30T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 9760000, "id": "P115762", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "YX", "name": "Industry and trade"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "docty": "Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Disbursement Letter,Grant or Trust Fund Agreement,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet,Environmental Assessment,Project Information Document,Project Information Document,Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet", "sector1": {"Percent": 91, "Name": "Other industry"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "VN", "sector2": {"Percent": 9, "Name": "Public administration- Industry and trade"}, "totalamt": 0, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "11", "name": "Environment and natural resources management"}, {"code": "11", "name": "Environment and natural resources management"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2012-11-13T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Vietnam", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "Montreal Protocol", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "East Asia and Pacific", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The development objective of the First Stage of the Hydro Chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) Phase-out Project is to reduce HCFC consumption in order to contribute to the Government of Vietnam's efforts to comply with its Montreal Protocol (MP) phase-out obligations for HCFCs to be met between January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2015. There are three components to the project. The first component is investment in HCFC-141b consumption phase-out. This component will support the cost of conversion to non-HCFC technology in the foam sector. It will consist of a series of investment activities (mainly procurement of equipment) at twelve foam producers. The project will promote the adoption of hydrocarbon technology in the foam sector, except in the manufacturing of integral skin shoe sole, where the water blown Carbon dioxide (CO2) system was found as the most cost-effective and suitable conversion method. Eligible incremental capital and operating costs for each enterprise has been determined on the basis of a conversion cost structure relevant to hydrocarbon/water blown (CO2) technology and subsequently approved by the Multilateral Fund Executive Committee. The second component is supporting policies and regulations and technical assistance activities. This component will provide technical assistance to the government agencies and involved beneficiaries and stakeholders to: (a) implement an import quota system to curb the supply of HCFCs; (b) recommend the government authorities not to issue licenses for establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities using HCFCs; (c) ban the import of bulk HCFC-141b by January 1, 2015 through the HCFC quota system; and (d) support workshops and training, awareness campaigns, and consultants' services (including studies) on the need to phase out HCFCs and on future regulatory measures. The third component is project management. A project management unit ('PMU'), under Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), will be established and financed to implement and coordinate project implementation and to assist MONRE to put in place regulations and sector specific policies."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "15-SEP-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081eca0b4_1_0", "DocURL":

efficiency through rehabilitation and maintenance of the national road infrastructure and enhanced public sector capacity to plan, regulate and monitor transport and logistics services. The funding level of the Program is not sufficient to improve, in absolute terms, the road network condition on the National Road Network as a whole. In this context, the Program is expected to ensure that the condition of the National Road Network remains a given threshold, as reflected in the key results. Such results are deemed to be the best achievable outcome at network level when compared not only to the past declining trend shown but also to counterfactual situation prevailing in the absence of support to the Program. The Program will be implemented by: (a) the Road Department of the ministry of transport and public works, and (b) the Uruguay Road Corporation. The CVU (Corporacion Vial del Uruguay - Uruguay Road Corporation) is linked to the MTOP (Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Publicas -  Ministry of Transport and Public Works) through: (a) a concession agreement, making CVU responsible for managing part of Uruguay's main road network, including highway maintenance, rehabilitation, and, as needed, development; and (b) a technical assistance agreement, through which DNV provides technical and administrative support to CVU. The Program is implemented through contracts to the private sector (road and bridge rehabilitation, performance-based rehabilitation, maintenance or performance-based maintenance) or through routine maintenance works executed by DNV (Direccion Nacional de Vialidad - Road DepartmenT) directly. Usually, except for bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction (design-build contracts), design and supervision functions required by Program-related activities are carried out by DNV staff."},

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is pilot adaptation initiatives to enhance climate resilience in the selected Municipalities. This component will support integrated adaptation projects to be implemented in four pilot Municipalities (Juigalpa, Murra, San Ramon and San Juan de Limay). The diversity of the local conditions will ensure that the implementation of the adaptation activities in these pilot areas generates lessons learned that can be replicated on a broader scale through subsequent adaptation investments. The second component of the project is coastal wetland protection and reduction of vulnerability to the sea level rise in the Municipality of Corn Island. This component will support the activities in the Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua, specifically in the Corn Island pilot Municipality. The third component of the project is institutional strengthening, project management and monitoring. This component will strengthen institutional capacity and coordination mechanisms at national and municipal levels to facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation into Nicaragua's water

Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan (DPL) Program for Colombia is to enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience of economic growth. The Government of Colombia has requested a DPL for US$200 million. The First DPL for US$300 million, approved by the Board in July 2011, supported the legislative approval of several important fiscal reforms. Building on the progress achieved under DPL I, this program document is the second DPL supporting the sustained implementation of these reforms. The request underscores the Government's continued interest in engaging with the World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal management. The fiscal reform program supported by the loan series seeks to enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen growth resilience. The program includes a series of measures that can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a) budget predictability and stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c) disaster risk financing. The first area includes the implementation of a fiscal rule and a tax reform. The second area covers important legal and regulatory changes to the health insurance system, including the update of the mandatory benefit package and the creation of a contingency fund. The final area includes the development of a national disaster financing strategy and measures to enhance agricultural insurance coverage within a holistic agricultural risk management strategy. The Government of Colombia has made substantial progress in implementing its ambitious fiscal reform program. During the first half of the Presidential term, Congress approved a series of major fiscal reforms, including: a fiscal rule, a reform of the royalties system, a fiscal sustainability constitutional change, tax reforms, and a health law. As detailed in this document, the Government has made good progress in implementing this legislative agenda.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged more than 5 percent per year in the period the 2002 debt crisis. The year 2011 was the ninth consecutive year of GDP growth, marking one of the longest growth periods in the country's history. Prudent macroeconomic policies, improvements in structural areas and favorable external economic conditions, such as buoyant demand for its main export products and a booming regional economy, have contributed to the strong economic performance of Uruguay and helped protect the economy during the 2008/2009 crisis. Private consumption continues to be the main driver of the economy. As in previous years, with the exception of 2009, when GDP growth was driven by the external sector, private consumption was the main driver of economic growth.

Program for Vietnam is to support the Government of Vietnam (GoV) in its efforts to address climate change by adopting policies and strengthening institutional capacity to promote climate resilient and lower carbon intensity development. Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5\u00b0C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister. The World Bank-financed climate change Development Policy Operation (DPO) programmatic series supports the implementation of the SP-RCC and is arranged under three pillars and four goals. The series is designed to support the GoV to define priorities and targets suitable for each stage of development through three annual programmatic operations. DPO2 was designed in close coordination with SP-RCC co-financiers as a continuation of DPO1.

A first component includes the following sub-components: 1) urban regeneration of Tskaltubo. An integrated approach for the urban renewal of Tskaltubo city: this includes a) rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure and utilities in the central area; b) upgrading of public spaces, parks, and construction of tourism amenities, and c) restoration of public buildings with vernacular architecture. The activities will help improve livability and hospitality in a culturally-informed manner, enhance attractiveness for visitors, revitalize the urban nucleus, and attract increased volume of private sector investments around the medical and spa tourism cluster. 2) tourism circuits development: an integrated approach to site upgrading and improved management of the six most attractive cultural heritage sites in Imereti: including Gelati Monastery; Vani Museum and surrounding archaeological site; the Ubisa Church; the Katskhi Church, the Katskhi Column Monastery, and the Motsameta Monastery. This includes a) improving urban landscaping and public parking; b) construction of information kiosks and public toilets; c) restoration and refurbishing of the exterior and interior of the Vani Museum; d) improving access roads; and e) preservation of selected cultural heritage sites. The second component is institutional development. The second component includes the following sub-components. 1) establishment of Tskaltubo destination management and development office: this will create the institutional framework to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all assets that will be constructed/rehabilitated in Tskaltubo, and conduct marketing and promotion activities for the Imereti region; 2) sustainable tourism development and promotion: this will promote Imereti as a new sustainable tourism destination and create a mechanism for community participation, stakeholder consultations, and involvement of local government in the region's tourism development; 3) preparation of visitor management plans for the sustainability of the project's cultural heritage sites; 4) skilled workforce development and capacity building: this will provide demand-driven capacity building training activities to three groups in order to establish a targeted, integrated workforce development program in tourism-related businesses in the Imereti region; 5) performance monitoring and evaluation; and 6) construction supervision support: this will provide Municipal Development Fund (MDF) with construction supervision from an international consulting firm."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "01-NOV-2013", "EntityID": "000442464_20131112103420", "DocURL":

objective of the Competitiveness Development Policy Operation Program is to improve competitiveness and thereby increase the volume of Moldovan exports, especially in European Union (EU) markets; and improve access to finance thereby promoting investment-led growth. This program document presents a Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO) for an amount of US$30 million. This is a single operation supporting the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Moldova to enhance growth through export competitiveness and increased access to finance. The Government's program for the period 2011-2014 represents a transition from the stabilization and recovery agenda to establishing a strong basis for growth driven by investment, innovation and competitiveness. The operation builds on and deepens the growth and trade-oriented structural reform agenda started under the economic recovery development policy operation, which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 24, 2010. The Government of the Republic of Moldova has an opportunity to implement reforms that would put the economy on a more sustainable export-led growth path. Emerging from the global economic crisis, Moldova's economic growth resumed swiftly in 2010 and 2011; however, the current Euro area crisis is likely to result in a slowdown of growth in 2012 and in the medium term. Moreover, despite the recovery in 2010 and 2011, job creation remained weak. The main driver of growth in 2010-2011 was private consumption, suggesting that the economy could be returning to the pre-crisis pattern of growth. Before the crisis, a decade of growth with weak job creation created a vicious cycle of migration, remittances, exchange rate appreciation, declines in tradable sectors, joblessness, and thus more migration. Heavy reliance on remittance-funded consumption and housing construction leaves the economy vulnerable to changes in the external environment and undermines Moldova's long-term competitiveness. The operation addresses binding constraints to economic growth by improving the returns to private investment and reducing the costs of finance."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "01-NOV-2012", "EntityID": "000445729_20130704123420", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130704123420", "DocType": "Summary of Discussion", "DocTypeDesc": "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "02-OCT-2012", "EntityID": "000386194_20121010011504", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121010011504", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 30000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Regulation and competition policy"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "47,45,77,40", "borrower": "REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA", "sectorcode": "AZ,BZ,YY,YZ,FZ", "sector3": {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Other domestic and international trade"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 30, "Name": "Finance"}, {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Industry and trade"}, {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Industry and trade"}, {"Percent": 10, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 10, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "board_approval_month": "November", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "40", "name": "Regulation and competition policy"}, {"code": "77", "name": "Rural policies and institutions"}, {"code": "45", "name": "Export development and competitiveness"}, {"code": "47", "name": "Regional integration"}], "countryname": "Republic of Moldova", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122226/competitiveness-developmenet-policy-operation?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Closed", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "FZ", "name": "General finance sector"}, {"code": "YZ", "name": "General industry and trade sector"}, {"code": "YY", "name": "Other domestic and international trade"}, {"code": "BZ", "name": "General public administration sector"}, {"code": "AZ", "name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c926"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Sanitation"}, {"Name": "Water supply"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Rural development"], "idacommamt": 200000000, "impagency": "MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT", "project_name": "Results-Based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Under the National Target Program", "mjthemecode": "10,2", "closingdate": "2018-07-31T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 200000000, "id": "P127435", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "WX", "name": "Water, sanitation and flood protection"}, {"code": "WX", "name": "Water, sanitation and flood protection"}], "docty": "Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Procurement Plan,Implementation Status and Results Report,Summary of Discussion,Project Appraisal Document,Environmental Assessment,Environmental Assessment,Working Paper,Working Paper,Program Information Document,Program Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 50, "Name": "Sanitation"}, "lendinginstr": "Program-for-Results", "countrycode": "VN", "sector2": {"Percent": 50, "Name": "Water supply"}, "totalamt": 200000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "2", "name": ""}], "boardapprovaldate": "2012-11-01T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Vietnam", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "East Asia and Pacific", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam!$!VN", "envassesmentcategorycode": "C", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The objective of the Results-Based Rural Water and Sanitation under the National Target Program Project for Vietnam is to increase sustained access to water supply and sanitation services and improve sector planning, monitoring and evaluation in the participating provinces of the Third Phase of the National Target Program for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (NTP3).

benefit from improved access to and use of basic infrastructure and services through a people-centered approach and to enhance the government's capacity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a pre arrears clearance grant in the amount of SDR52.6 million (US$80 million equivalent) to the project. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with an estimated gross domestic product per capita of between US$500-800. While reliable poverty data are scarce in Myanmar, all indicators point to poverty being concentrated in rural areas: two rounds of household surveys (in 2005 and 2009) supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlight significant differences in poverty across geographical areas, with rural poverty considerably higher than urban poverty. Available figures also suggest that social indicators are poor; with for example 32 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, the highest rate in the region. Agriculture is the mainstay of the national economy, generating 43 percent of gross domestic product, 54 percent of employment and providing livelihoods to more that 70 percent of the population. However, the sector is characterized by a number of constraints, including limited irrigation; little value added agro processing capacity, poor policy settings, and widespread indebtedness in rural communities. Fundamental to the triple transition is a 'paradigm shift' to a 'people-centered approach,' as articulated by President Thein Sein. This encompasses greater attention to the delivery of services, a greater proportion of government budget to health and education, and a shift from 'top-down' to 'bottom-up' planning. This shift holds out the promise of change in state-society relations, following a half century of rule by successive military governments. The project will support this paradigm shift and 'people-centered' development by enabling poor rural communities to lead the identification of needs and implementation of activities aimed at promoting access to basic services and rural infrastructure. This will both empower communities and allow the government to deliver visible results of reform at the community level. In addition, the project will engender more constructive relationships between government and communities, and will support rural poverty alleviation, a stated objective of the government's economic reforms. If successful, the project, which will be implemented in 15 of Myanmar's 330 townships, can be scaled up across the country."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "03-AUG-2013",

Program (PDPG6) for Tajikistan is to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The PDPG6 of SDR 13.2 million (US$ 20 million equivalent) is the third in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan. The PDPG4-6 series is central to the World Bank's engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). It supports the government's two-pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and poverty reduction. The series builds on the PDPG1-3 series completed in 2009, and seeks to (i) protect social spending and increase its efficiency, (ii) improve the climate for private sector development, and (iii) strengthen government effectiveness. PDPG4 and PDPG5 focused on protecting earlier social sectors gains, and on improving the environment for private investment. The 2008-09 global economic crisis adversely affected Tajikistan through lower remittances and exports. Growth slowed to 3.9 percent, PDPG6 supports the economic recovery underway following the 2009 slowdown. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has recovered to more than 6 percent in 2010 and 2011. Accordingly, the focus of the PDPG series has shifted from protecting earlier social sector gains to improving the environment for private sector development and strengthening government effectiveness. PDPG6 supports continued implementation of health and education financing reforms and ongoing efforts to improve targeting effectiveness of social assistance. To help spur private sector-led growth, the government has submitted a new law on public private partnerships to Parliament in August 2012, and has continued expedited issuance of land-use certificates to farmers.

The project has three components. (1) Real estate registration data development component will support land register and cadastre data harmonization on land, buildings and rights based on the actual situation in the field. (2) Real estate registration infrastructure development component will continue Land Registration Project (LRP) work in improving working conditions and infrastructure in the cadastre offices across the country and in those few land registration offices in the FBH that were not targeted by LRP through: office renovations and purchases; creation of digital archives; and provision of furniture and equipment. The office purchases planned in RS have to be approved by the Land Committee of the World Bank. Policy and institutional development, and project management component will support policy and legal development in support of reaching the project development objective. The objective is to enhance sustainability of the real estate registration. The component will have a strong focus on institutional development and capacity building, addressing the long term challenges of sustainability and governance of real estate registers and emphasizing financial sustainability, quality of service and client orientation and social vulnerabilities."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "30-JUL-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081d86d0d_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d86d0d_1_0", "DocType": "ISRR", "DocTypeDesc": "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "17-JUL-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081db46fc_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081db46fc_1_0", "DocType": "PRA", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "23-MAY-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081c778a8_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c778a8_1_0", "DocType": "PRA", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "28-JAN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0818d09e6_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818d09e6_1_0", "DocType": "ISRR", "DocTypeDesc": "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "25-JAN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081c77d06_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c77d06_1_0", "DocType": "Disbursement Letter", "DocTypeDesc": "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "25-JAN-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081c778a3_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c778a3_1_0", "DocType": "FIA", "DocTypeDesc": "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "24-SEP-2012", "EntityID": "000350881_20121010090214", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20121010090214", "DocType": "PAD", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "31-MAY-2012", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2012053111430337", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012053111430337", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "15-MAY-2012", "EntityID": "0000A8056_2012051516472844", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012051516472844", "DocType": "ISDS", "DocTypeDesc": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "01-MAR-2012", "EntityID": "000386194_20120510025844", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120510025844", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "01-MAR-2012", "EntityID": "000386194_20120510025527", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120510025527", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 34100000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 4, "Name": "Participation and civic engagement"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "36,83,57", "borrower": "THE GOVERNMENT OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA", "sectorcode": "BS,CA,BG,BM", "sector3": {"Percent": 15, "Name": "Information technology"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 50, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 15, "Name": "Information and communications"}, {"Percent": 15, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "board_approval_month": "October", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "57", "name": "Participation and civic engagement"}, {"code": "83", "name": "Land administration and management"}, {"code": "36", "name": "Personal and property rights"}], "countryname": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P128950/real-estate-registration-project?lang=en", "source": "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "BM", "name": "Public administration- Information and communications"}, {"code": "BG", "name": "Law and justice"}, {"code": "CA", "name": "Information technology"}, {"code": "BS", "name": "Public administration- Other social services"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c92e"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways"}], "supplementprojectflg": "Y", "projectfinancialtype": "IBRD", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Financial and private sector development", "Social dev/gender/inclusion"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "HPRIDC, GOVERNMENT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH", "project_name": "HP State Roads Project -

The growth outlook for Tanzania continues to remain optimistic, although there are certain risks. The economy is estimated to grow by 6.8 percent in 2012, slightly lower than the previous year. The medium term growth outlook remains positive. Achieving a buoyant outlook is dependent on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, structural reforms, and carrying out sound public finance policy and public financial management. However, this remains vulnerable to domestic and external shocks including the Euro zone debt crisis. The level of foreign aid is already projected to decline significantly in FY2012/13. Fiscal consolidation for the central government is on track and is in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy support instrument program. The budget framework for 2012/13 is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), closer to the level before the global financial crisis. The latest debt sustainability analysis (June 2012) shows that Tanzania's risk of debt stress remains low but is sensitive to borrowing terms and the government's fiscal position. Given the uncertainties in the external environment and the public investments through parastatals, Tanzania needs to manage its fiscal and debt sustainability. In 2004, Government of Tanzania (GoT) introduced the Local Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) as a grant flow to local governments. Prior to the introduction of the LGCDG, direct development grants to Local Government Authority (LGAs) were minimal and not performance based. LGAs received certain additional development resources from sectoral development programs and from area-based development programs. The LGCDG has evolved into the Local Government Development Grant (LGDG) program with several sub-programs and has become a mainstream performance based fiscal transfer. By introducing LGDG the government program the Government created a formula-based, transparent and predictable fiscal flow mechanism to disburse funds to all 133 LGAs in the country, on the basis of the institutional performance achieved. The main thrust of the LGDG system is to incentivize the improved institutional performance of LGAs while providing discretionary and sector-specific funding for development purposes. The LGDG system's chief goal is to improve the overall, long-term functioning of the local government system in Tanzania, so as to improve the quality of investments. More specifically, its objectives are to:1) enhance the delivery and management capabilities, productive efficiencies and financial sustainability of local governments; 2) improve access of communities especially the poor, to local services through expanding the physical stock of new and rehabilitated infrastructure; 3) improve the sustainability of local development infrastructure through ensuring proper planning and adequate operations and maintenance (O&M); and 4) provide a national system for the delivery of development grants to LGAs."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs":

urban poor in Bolivia's major cities through targeted infrastructure investments and the provision of technical assistance to municipalities in the planning, expansion and sustainability of urban service delivery. The main change introduced is the revision of the monitoring indicators (excluding project development objective, or PDO-related indicators) and targets. Specifically, some indicators have been revised to better capture project outcomes and the target values for components 1 and 2 have been modified to reflect the scaling-up of project activities. Target values for component 3 have been fully achieved during implementation of the Parent Project (PP) and are not being modified since this component will not be scaled-up.  The AF will support the scale up of two of the three components (components 1 and 2). All components have met their targets; the decision to scale up only activities under components 1 (La Paz) and 2 (El Alto) is based on the Borrower's decision to prioritize investments in the poorer areas of the country. The AF will extend the closing date of the PP to October 31, 2015. In addition, the PP financing agreement will be amended to reflect the changes."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "17-SEP-2012", "EntityID": "000333037_20121214014525", "DocURL":

"The development objective of the Accelerated Food Security Project for Tanzania is to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by improving farmers' access to critical agricultural inputs. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent) to the project. This will be the project's first Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in the country, the improvement of national food security, and the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade. Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the 2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage is critically important in the context of high international fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices. The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on grain production. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the commitment would be defined within the next phase of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the development of this commitment has been postponed to allow for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and performance. The new ASDP funding is now only expected to be available in late 2013. The AF will support the maintenance of the subsidy program during the 2012/13 gap year."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "02-OCT-2012", "EntityID": "000386194_20121008011809", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121008011809", "DocType": "PJPR", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "08-AUG-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20120913094252", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120913094252", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "01-MAR-2009", "EntityID": "000333038_20121029013545", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029013545", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 2"}, {"DocDate": "01-AUG-2005", "EntityID": "000333038_20121029012430", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029012430", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 2"}], "lendprojectcost": 25000000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 20, "Name": "Global food crisis response"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "79,91", "borrower": "UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA", "sectorcode": "AH", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 100, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "board_approval_month": "October", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "91", "name": "Global food crisis response"}, {"code": "79", "name": "Other rural development"}], "countryname": "United Republic of Tanzania", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P132780/accelerated-food-security-project-additional-financing?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "AH", "name": "Crops"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c935"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Irrigation and drainage"}, {"Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, {"Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}, {"Name": "Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}, {"Name": "General public administration sector"}], "supplementprojectflg": "Y", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Rural development", "Financial and private sector development", "Human development", "Rural development", "Rural development"], "idacommamt": 30000000, "impagency": "MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SECURITY AND COOPERATIVE", "project_name": "Tanzania: Third Additional Financing for Agricultural Sector Development Project", "mjthemecode": "10,4,8,10,10", "totalcommamt": 30000000, "id": "P132838", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}, {"code": "YX", "name": "Industry and trade"}, {"code": "BX", "name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "docty": "Environmental Assessment,Project Paper,Project Information Document", "sector1": {"Percent": 30, "Name": "Irrigation and drainage"}, "lendinginstr": "Specific Investment Loan", "countrycode": "TZ", "sector2": {"Percent": 25, "Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, "totalamt": 30000000, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "4", "name": "Financial and private sector development"}, {"code": "8", "name": "Human development"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}, {"code": "10", "name": "Rural development"}], "boardapprovaldate": "2012-10-23T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Tanzania", "sector4": {"Percent": 15, "Name": "Agro-industry, marketing, and trade"}, "prodlinetext": "IBRD/IDA", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Africa", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "United Republic of Tanzania!$!TZ", "envassesmentcategorycode": "B", "project_abstract": {"cdata": "The development objective of the Third Additional Financing for the Agricultural Sector Development Project is to enable farmers to have better access to and use of agricultural knowledge, technologies, marketing systems, and infrastructure and to promote agricultural private investment based on an improved regulatory and policy environment.

objective of the Remote Rural Communities Development Project for Bhutan is to increase agriculture productivity and access to community assets in remote rural areas by improving access to markets, irrigation, agricultural technologies, and community infrastructure. There are three components to the project. The first component is rural infrastructure. The focus of this component is to connect the communities to larger roads and regional markets and to improve production potential through improved availability of irrigation. The second component is community, marketing and productive infrastructure. This component will cover investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure, critical community-level infrastructure, and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity. The third component is project management and institutional strengthening. This component supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation functions of the project. It covers: (a) technical and financial management, (b) procurement, and (c) supervision of compliance with environmental and social safeguards. This component will strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MoAF) to effectively coordinate implementation and provide procurement support to local communities as needed. This component will also support midterm and end-of-project project monitoring surveys that would provide project performance information at the activity, output, and outcome levels to meet the requirements of the existing Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) monitoring system and the Planning and Monitoring System (PLAMS)."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "04-SEP-2013",

in a sustainable manner. The DPC2 reinforces reform areas supported by the First Development Policy Credit (DPC1) and builds the earlier policy-based operations. The DPC2 is aligned with World Bank's strategic directions set out in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY11-14). The main risks are: (a) aggregate demand pressures could linger resulting in persistent rupee shortage. Mitigating factors include: recent monetary and fiscal tightening; a calibration of capital spending by the Royal Government of Bhutan, or RGoB based on foreign grants or loans; and commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination between Ministry of Finance, the Royal Monetary Authority, in consultation with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced by quarterly review of macroeconomic performance. The expansion of the existing line of credit with the Government of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should help ease pressures on the rupee; (b) capacity constraints due to the small scale of government, mitigated by the RGoB's ongoing capacity building efforts (in many areas supported by development partners); and (c) political risk of changing government priorities, mitigated by the RGoB's wide consultations on the development agenda and its commitment to sustaining reforms."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "13-OCT-2012", "EntityID": "090224b0817a7399_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817a7399_1_0", "DocType": "FIA", "DocTypeDesc": "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol."}, {"DocDate": "27-AUG-2012", "EntityID": "000333037_20120912001127", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120912001127", "DocType": "PGD", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "20-JUL-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20120725095348", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120725095348", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "23-MAY-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20120525102728", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120525102728", "DocType": "PGID", "DocTypeDesc": "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 36000000, "lendinginstrtype": "AD", "theme1": {"Percent": 15, "Name": "Regulation and competition policy"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "51,52,42,27,40", "borrower": "ROYAL GOVERNMENT OF BHUTAN", "sectorcode": "TZ,BH,YZ,BC", "sector3": {"Percent": 12, "Name": "Sub-national government administration"}, "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 38, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 38, "Name": "Industry and trade"}, {"Percent": 12, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}, {"Percent": 12, "Name": "Transportation"}], "board_approval_month": "October", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "40", "name": "Regulation and competition policy"}, {"code": "27", "name": "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement"}, {"code": "42", "name": "International financial standards and systems"}, {"code": "52", "name": "Natural disaster management"}, {"code": "51", "name": "Improving labor markets"}], "countryname": "Kingdom of Bhutan", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P128201/bt-dpc-2?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Closed", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "BC", "name": "Central government administration"}, {"code": "YZ", "name": "General industry and trade sector"}, {"code": "BH", "name": "Sub-national government administration"}, {"code": "TZ", "name": "General transportation sector"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c940"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Hydropower"}, {"Name": "Irrigation and drainage"}, {"Name": "Sub-national government administration"}, {"Name": "Other social services"}, {"Name": "Agricultural extension and research"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "IDA", "prodline": "PE", "mjtheme": ["Urban development", "Environment and natural resources management", "Rural development", "Trade and integration"], "idacommamt": 203000000, "impagency": "NIGER BASIN AUTHORITY (NBA)", "project_name": "First Part of the Second Phase of the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable Ecosystems Management Program -

There are five components to the project. The first component is Panchayat Sarkar Bhawan. This component involves construction and making functional Panchayat Sarkar Bhawans in approximately 300 gram panchayats. The second component is capacity building for Panchayat Raj Institutions. This component builds panchayats' core institutional competencies to empower them to achieve substantive development outcomes. The component also engages communities and citizens, through training, mobilization, and media, to participate in local governance and to hold panchayats accountable. The third component is strengthening the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. This component will strengthen the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. The fourth component is panchayat performance grant. The annual best panchayat grant will reward exceptional panchayats that are inclusive, responsive and accountable. The recipients of the grant will be selected on a competitive basis. The competition criteria will include core institutional quality indicators related to how a panchayat runs its administration, how it interacts with its citizens, and how it manages resources and promotes local development. The competition will be based on objective information collected through the project information system with a validation process. Annually, the project will recognize the best gram panchayat in each district and block, and award them block grants, which are significantly higher than what they currently receive. The project will support this league of good panchayats to develop high impact initiatives that the grants will finance. The fifth component is project management and coordination. Government of Bihar (GoB) has established a Bihar Gram Swaraj Yojana Society (BGSYS) as the implementation agency for the project. The society is expected to play four critical roles: (i) A catalyst role: public awareness campaign, policy advocacy, innovative capacity building for visible development results, proactive partnership with Non-government Organizations (NGOs) to stimulate demand for accountability and improve PRI responsiveness; (ii) a technical support role: to support partner line departments to establish capacity in managing the devolution process and building PRIs capacity in the relevant service delivery area; (iii) a coordination role: coordinate, monitor and report on the devolution and PRI strengthening process; and (iv) a fiduciary role: project financing management, procurement and reporting.

The project will continue to be implemented by Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MTPTEC). Specifically, the AF will help finance the following modified and additional activities: a) improve efficiency and transparency in public resource use and strengthen Haiti's public sector management systems to improve overall governance and anticorruption and enhance the institutional foundation for continued reconstruction and post reconstruction recovery; b) ensure continuity of existing critical activities related to the continued reconstruction phase, including the restoration of key economic and financial functions of the Government of Haiti (GoH), and the rehabilitation of selected public infrastructure; rehabilitate the aviation safety equipment, and foster further economic recovery through continued activities at the Trutier Debris Processing Facility, as well as

In addition, about 65 river-crossings will be financed under this component in order to ensure minimal access at locations selected for their importance for agricultural productivity or to give access to social services. (2) Community-based road maintenance and annual mechanized maintenance component will finance the maintenance of the roads rehabilitated under Component 1, as well as a few other pilot roads to build up the maintenance system while the roads are being rehabilitated. Pilot programs will be initiated in each one of the tier-one states for up to 50 km of rural roads rehabilitated through other means. (3) Project Management and Strengthening of State and Federal Road Sector Institutional, Policy and Regulatory Framework component will provide a comprehensive institutional development package at the state and federal levels to: (a) support an effective implementation of the project (including through technical audits, whenever needed); (b) design and implement sound rural transport policies; (c)

The supervision services will also include design review and design stage road safety audits for each road. Each of the selected roads are either import and export regional trade corridors, corridors that provide access to investment or development areas, or important link roads that connect trunk roads. Finally, the second component is the support to modernize Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA).

objective of the Mining Sector Governance Support Project for Guinea is to strengthen the capacity and governance systems of key institutions for managing the minerals sector in Guinea. There are three components to the project. The first component is facilitating access to mineral resources. This component will focus on supporting the Government of Guinea (GoG) in developing the capacities and systems to facilitate negotiation and contracting with private sector mining companies including mining ancillary infrastructure. It will further strengthen the governance and institutional structure of Societe Guineenne du Patrimoine Minier (State-Owned Guinean Mining Company) (SOUGIPAMI) and its technical, legal, and financial capacities to engage with mining projects sponsors. The second component is institutional strengthening for mineral management. This component will focus on strengthening the GoG capacities to license, control and monitor technical, environmental, and financial compliance of mining operations. The third component is promoting economic development of mining areas and good governance. This component will focus on sustainable investments. This will include the facilitation of regional and local development plans through partnerships with the private sector, and the strengthening of mechanisms for demand for good governance (DFG). This component will have a regional aspect, in that it will most likely focus on at least one 'growth corridor,' (iron-ore in the South-East or Bauxite/Alumina in the North-West). It will build on work carried out under previous studies, and seek synergies with International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other donor activities. The fourth component is project management. This component will support the project implementation unit, based in the Ministry of Mines, in the management of fiduciary activities, project monitoring and evaluation and the implementation of

the Forest Fire Response Project for the Russian Federation is to improve forest fire prevention and management and to enhance sustainable forest management. Furthermore, the project will contribute to raising public awareness and education standards in forestry issues in general, with specific reference to forest fires prevention/control and forest governance issues. There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is enhancing forest fire prevention, management, and control. This component aims to improve the effectiveness of forest fire prevention and management by: (i) improving the capacity for early detection and quick response to fight forest fires, and (ii) reducing the number of fires of human origin through awareness raising and environmental education programs. Early fire detection is recognized as a key element in improving protection of forests from fires. Fire prevention and environmental education will be focused on children and youth as a means to encourage long-term behavior change. The second component of the project is building forestry and Protected Area (PA) management capacity. This component will increase forest and PA management capacity and help address key policy and management issues that either create perverse incentives or exacerbate conditions contributing to the extent and intensity of fires in the extensive forest landscape and protected areas. The third component of the project is project management will finance the operating costs of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which will undertake project management functions for both components one and two.

The program will support the authorities with critical knowledge and technical assistance for implementing reforms. Analytical underpinnings for the reform program will be provided by existing and programmed analytical work. Analytical work that has already shaped the government's ongoing reform agenda includes public expenditure reviews, a strategy for strengthening budget management, a public financial management performance report, a review of administrative barriers to private sector development and business environment in the Seychelles, and a review of the policy regulatory and administrative environment. The government greatly values the technical assistance and policy dialogue that the bank can provide through its DPLs. Technical assistance in this program will be funded partly by reimbursable technical assistance. The bank brings global knowledge about good practice and helps to ensure evidence-based discussions around the reform agenda.

There are three components to the project. The first component is road rehabilitation. This component will finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of the M-03 road between Lubny and Poltava. The civil works to be funded from the loan will cover about 108km. The M-03 road connects the industrial areas in eastern Ukraine to Kiev, and is also part of the European road corridor E-40. Physical works will include the rehabilitation of the existing 4-lane road sections and the widening of other sections from two to four lanes, to ensure that the entire road is in line with the Ukrainian motorway standard. In addition to the increase in road capacity and the improvement of road conditions, this component will result in major road safety benefits. Widening to four lanes will greatly reduce the risk of head-on collisions, which are today the main cause of crashes and traffic fatalities of this road. The second component is road safety improvements. This component will finance two types of activities: (i) safety improvements along several high risk road corridors; and (ii) introduction of improved road safety features on the existing M-03 sections in urbanized areas which will remain even after bypasses will be built around those under component one. For the former, a comprehensive road safety assessment is being carried out under the ongoing RSIP, using the risk mapping and star rating approach of the International Road Assessment Program (IRAP). The third component is institutional support and strengthening. Under this component the Bank will complement the institutional assistance already being provided by other development partners, in support of the Government's concept for the road sector reform program enacted through the Cabinet of Ministers dated August 3, 2011. This component will support: (i) the development of a strategic program for road sector development until 2030; and (ii) the enhancement of the capacity of Ukravtodor, the Ukrainian State Institute for Design of Roads (Ukrdiprodor) and other Ukrainian institutions, for designing and building safer roads. Technical assistance will be provided to help Ukravtodor in developing a strategic program for road development, covering also institutional strengthening, financial sustainability and the social and

The second component of the project is household energy. This component supports the efforts of various Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in providing rural households with clean cooking solutions. The component will build on the success of Bangladeshi NGOs in the areas of community outreach in total sanitation programs. The third component of the project is energy efficient lighting. This component will support the distribution of 7.25 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in predominantly rural areas where these energy efficient CFLs are not yet widely used.

There are three components to the project. The first component is performance grant. This component focuses on two areas of urban governance: resource planning and management, seeking to improve decision making, consolidate revenue sources and strengthen resource mobilization; and transparency and voice in the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of plans and programs in urban areas. This component will provide an annual grant to the project cities, based on achievement of specified annual targets against a set of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in selected governance areas. The second component is project implementation and capacity building. This component supports the cities and province through technical assistance and capacity building to achieve the DLIs and enhancement in revenue. The Urban Sector Planning and Management Services Unit (USPMSU), and a City Program Unit (CPU) in each of the five cities will be responsible for providing this support and the corresponding costs will be financed from this component. The third component is contingent emergency response. This component will support preparedness and rapid response to disaster, emergency, and/or catastrophic events, as needed. The provisional zero cost for this component will allow for rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures.

The Project will provide US$25 million to support IIGF in issuing its own IIGF guarantees for qualifying projects. Qualifying projects will be those which are apprised by the WB and meet WB policies as well as other reputational risk considerations. In order to prevent the mingling of this $25 million with IIGF capital, the WB loan proceeds under component one will be disbursed at the time a claim is properly made and assessed as payable by IIGF with respect to an IIGF guarantee for a WB-Supported IIGF-project. The second component of the project is technical assistance (TA). The Project will provide a loan for TA in the amount of approximately $4.6 million to develop IIGF's institutional capacity to: screen, appraise and supervise IIGF-projects as a single window for all government guarantees for infrastructure PPPs in Indonesia; manage its operations; build capacity in Contracting Agencies (CAs), sponsors and other relevant parties; develop standardized documents and procedures for contracting agencies, sponsors and other relevant parties to use in preparing PPP projects and require the use of such documents and procedures in order for PPP projects to receive IIGF

reliable electricity services, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through demand side response and efficiency gains. There are three components to the project. The first component is system expansion and reinforcement. This component will cover construction and reinforcement of 110 kV, Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) electricity distribution networks, including substations, of the PCs. These investments will help the PCs to efficiently meet load growth, address load supply constraints due to distribution system congestion, reduce losses, and improve reliability and quality of power supply. The second component is introduction of smart grid technologies in distribution. This component, which includes Clean Technology Fund (CTF) co-financing, will focus on (i) automation, through introduction of supervisory control and data acquisition systems, of electricity distribution network operations of and data collection by the PCs; and (ii) introduction of Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, including two-way communication systems, as electricity distribution smart grid technologies for key substations and consumers of selected PCs. Supporting the first stage of the roadmap for smart grid technologies for power distribution in Vietnam, the component will assist to increase efficiency, reliability and effectiveness of the PCs' systems and operations, and optimize distribution system configuration by providing real time data from both the supply and the demand side. The third component is technical assistance and capacity building. Provision of technical assistance to and capacity building of Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERAV) for improvement of efficiency in electricity tariffs, enhancement of efficiency of and incorporation of smart grid technologies in the grid and distribution codes, integration of renewable energy in the grid and distribution codes, development of demand response and smart grid programs, and project management and monitoring and evaluation. Building on the technical assistance and capacity building under on-going Bank projects and the Bank support to power sector reform and tariff regulation, third component will complement the investment in the previous two components through building capacity and implementing arrangements to maximize improvements in PCs' efficiency and achieve reductions in demand compared to Business as usual (BAU), to achieve project development objectives and indicators."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "27-OCT-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081fe91f4_1_0", "DocURL":

These overruns are due to underestimation of the number of land records to be entered per district at the time of appraisal of the parent project and moderately higher unit costs per data entry in comparison with the original estimate."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "02-AUG-2012", "EntityID": "000333037_20120820233859", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120820233859", "DocType": "PJPR", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "04-JUN-2012", "EntityID": "000104615_20120618152107", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120618152107", "DocType": "PID", "DocTypeDesc": "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1"}, {"DocDate": "01-MAY-2012", "EntityID": "000356161_20120606021919", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120606021919", "DocType": "EA", "DocTypeDesc": "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1"}], "lendprojectcost": 70000000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 10, "Name": "Administrative and civil service reform"}, "grantamt": 0, "themecode": "83,36,25", "borrower": "ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN", "sectorcode": "BH", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 100, "Name": "Public Administration, Law, and Justice"}], "board_approval_month": "September", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "25", "name": "Administrative and civil service reform"}, {"code": "36", "name": "Personal and property rights"}, {"code": "83", "name": "Land administration and management"}], "countryname": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131266/punjab-land-records-management-information-systems-project-additional-financing?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "BH", "name": "Sub-national government administration"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c95e"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "OTHER", "prodline": "RE", "mjtheme": ["Social dev/gender/inclusion"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "UT'Z CHE", "project_name": "Strengthening the resilience capacity of Maya indigenous peoples and peasants to cope with food insecurity and CC in GT dry-corridor", "mjthemecode": "7,1", "closingdate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z", "totalcommamt": 2510000, "id": "P130412", "mjsector_namecode": [{"code": "AX", "name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "docty": "Implementation Status and Results Report", "sector1": {"Percent": 100, "Name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}, "lendinginstr": "Technical Assistance Loan", "countrycode": "GT", "totalamt": 0, "mjtheme_namecode": [{"code": "7", "name": "Social dev/gender/inclusion"}, {"code": "1", "name": ""}], "boardapprovaldate": "2012-09-10T00:00:00Z", "countryshortname": "Guatemala", "source": "IBRD", "prodlinetext": "Recipient Executed Activities", "productlinetype": "L", "regionname": "Latin America and Caribbean", "status": "Active", "country_namecode": "Republic of Guatemala!$!GT", "envassesmentcategorycode": "U", "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "24-APR-2013", "EntityID": "090224b081b011bc_1_0", "DocURL": "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b011bc_1_0", "DocType": "ISRR", "DocTypeDesc": "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol."}], "lendprojectcost": 2510000, "lendinginstrtype": "IN", "theme1": {"Percent": 100, "Name": "Other social development"}, "grantamt": 2510000, "themecode": "62", "borrower": "UT'Z CHE", "sectorcode": "AZ", "majorsector_percent": [{"Percent": 100, "Name": "Agriculture, fishing, and forestry"}], "board_approval_month": "September", "theme_namecode": [{"code": "62", "name": "Other social development"}], "countryname": "Republic of Guatemala", "url": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P130412/strengthening-resilience-capacity-maya-indigenous-peoples-peasants-cope-food-insecurity-cc-gt-dry-corridor?lang=en", "projectstatusdisplay": "Active", "ibrdcommamt": 0, "sector_namecode": [{"code": "AZ", "name": "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector"}], "_id": {"$oid": "52b213b38594d8a2be17c95f"}}, {"sector": [{"Name": "Other Mining and Extractive Industries"}], "supplementprojectflg": "N", "projectfinancialtype": "OTHER", "prodline": "RE", "mjtheme": ["Public sector governance"], "idacommamt": 0, "impagency": "MINISTRY OF MINES, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT", "project_name": "Zambia -

The second component is community mobilization and Behavior Change Communication (BCC). This component will strengthen the supply and demand-side interface of the ICDS program, especially at the point of delivery of nutrition services, and will rigorously monitor and evaluate this interface. The component will focus on excluded and marginalized groups. The development of a management model that emphasizes efficiency on the basis of mutual accountability between caregivers and beneficiaries will be a significant area of support. The third component is convergent nutrition action. This component will support the Government of India's efforts to initiate, and subsequently expand, a comprehensive convergent nutrition response to complement the ICDS, in order to address the multiple determinants of malnutrition. The fourth component is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component will support effective project management including: (i) financing specialists in a variety of fields to strengthen the operation of the established Project Management Units (PMUs) at the central and state level. Support will also include financing of office equipment, renting of vehicles, travel costs for key program staff, participation in planning/review/dissemination workshops, participation in study tours and conferences in order to facilitate a cross fertilization of ideas and an assimilation in the program of nutrition related best practices, and incremental operating costs; (ii) financing administrative costs of a technical agency to provide required technical support for program implementation, including the cost of core teams at the central and state levels, their office expenses and travel costs for training and evaluations; and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes, including designing an independent impact evaluation study, carrying out a baseline survey as well as annual rapid assessments on program coverage and behavior change, quarterly internal assessments by ICDS supervisors in randomly selected Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), and social assessments and an ethnographic study in minority and hard to reach areas to assess service delivery and effectiveness of communication outreach.

assist the Government of Rio de Janeiro in strengthening its tax administration, improving the efficiency of public financial management, increasing the quality of public service provision in education and health and ensuring that policies adopted are both consistent with priorities of the State Government and with resources likely to be available in the medium term. This program document presents a DPL in the amount of US$300 million for the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This DPL is designed to assist the Government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) in continuing its efforts to improve fiscal management, social service delivery in health and education, and public financial management. Although requested as a stand-alone DPL, the operation forms part of a long term quasi programmatic engagement with the State. It is the third DPL operation with the state of Rio de Janeiro. The policies supported by this third DPL are part of the GORJ's medium-term reform program and would deepen and extend the areas covered by the first DPL. Specifically, the operation will support measures to: (i) improve the efficiency of tax administration; (ii) improve budgetary management, including screening and evaluation of new public investment projects, better estimating costs of new policy initiatives, and strengthening internal controls; and (iii) increase quality and efficiency of the education system, by introducing merit-based selection processes for school managers, annual school-level performance targets, and performance-linked pay, and in the health system by increasing the efficiency of health spending, both in regional hospitals and smaller municipalities."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "20-MAR-2013", "EntityID": "090224b0819ff8ee_1_0", "DocURL":

"The development objective of the Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 8) Program for Lao PDR is to support policies and institutional reforms that enable the sustainable management of increasing revenues from the natural resource sectors to deliver improved public services. This will enable the country to more effectively translate these revenues into better development outcomes and improved public service delivery. The five policy areas in the new PRSO directly support the strategic objectives of World Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of (i) improving competitiveness and connectivity, (ii) sustainable resource management, (iii) inclusive development, and the crosscutting theme of strategic public sector management. Additionally, this third PRSO series builds on lessons learned from the previous second PSRO series. To ensure impact and results from the previously supported reforms, the third PRSO series continues support in some policy areas while aiming to selectively open new fronts of support for reform to meet the country's development challenges that include diversified and inclusive growth. The preparation of the new PRSO series included extensive consultations with all stakeholders, and close cooperation with the European Commission (EC). This PRSO series arrives at a critical time as Lao PDR's economy benefits from abundant natural resources, which, if managed well, may put the country on a sustainable and inclusive medium-term growth path. Lao PDR's forests, agricultural land, water and mineral resources and hydropower potential account for more than half of the country's total wealth. With appropriate macroeconomic and governance policies, the country's natural resource wealth can contribute significantly towards rapid, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Rapid expansion of the hydropower and mining sectors has benefited the country by contributing towards general economic growth, increasing fiscal revenues significantly, and reducing local poverty and improving infrastructure. It has also promoted change in environmental legislation."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "31-AUG-2012", "EntityID": "090224b0816d97b2_1_0", "DocURL":

objectives of the National Urban Transport Improvement Project for Kenya are to: (a) improve the efficiency of road transport along the Northern corridor; (b) improve the institutional capacity and arrangements in the urban transport sub-sector; and (c) promote the private sector participation in the operation, financing and management of transport systems. There are three components to the project, the first component being support to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to upgrade the urban road transport infrastructure. This component will involve: constructing and rehabilitating non-motorized transport facilities, including foot paths, cycle tracks, pedestrian bridges and underpasses; and carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering design studies of roads adjoining major towns and studies for improvement of traffic flows through provision of technical advisory services. The second component is the support to Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to develop selected mass transit corridors. The activities under this component of the project, which include carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding and contract documents for works and associated facilities as well as selection of private sector operators to provide large capacity buses for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and rolling stock for a commuter rail system are a precursor for a successor project. Finally, the third component is the institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support and deepen the implementation of reforms in the transport sector with a major focus on urban transport."}, "approvalfy": "2013", "projectdocs": [{"DocDate": "22-OCT-2013",
