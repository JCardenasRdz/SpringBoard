    "\n",
    "[Linear Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a method to model the relationship between a set of independent variables $X$ (also knowns as explanatory variables, features, predictors) and a dependent variable $Y$.  This method assumes the relationship between each predictor $X$ is **linearly** related to the dependent variable $Y$. The most basic linear regression model contains one independent variable $X$, we'll call this the simple model. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is considered as an unobservable random variable that adds noise to the linear relationship. In linear regression, $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0. In other words, what this means is that on average, if we know $Y$, a roughly equal number of predictions $\\hat{Y}$ will be above $Y$ and others will be below $Y$. That is, on average, the error is zero. The residuals, $\\epsilon$ are also assumed to be \"i.i.d.\": independently and identically distributed. Independence means that the residuals are not correlated -- the residual from one prediction has no effect on the residual from another prediction. Correlated errors are common in time series analysis and spatial analyses.\n",

    "* $\\beta_0$ is the intercept of the linear model and represents the average of $Y$ when all independent variables $X$ are set to 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Back to the simple model. The model in linear regression is the *conditional mean* of $Y$ given the values in $X$ is expressed a linear function.  \n",

    "### Fitting Linear Regression using `statsmodels`\n",
    "***\n",
    "[Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) is a great Python library for a lot of basic and inferential statistics. It also provides basic regression functions using an R-like syntax, so it's commonly used by statisticians. While we don't cover statsmodels officially in the Data Science Intensive workshop, it's a good library to have in your toolbox. Here's a quick example of what you could do with it. The version of least-squares we will use in statsmodels is called *ordinary least-squares (OLS)*. There are many other versions of least-squares such as [partial least squares (PLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression) and [weighted least squares (WLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratively_reweighted_least_squares)."

    "There is a ton of information in this output. But we'll concentrate on the coefficient table (middle table). We can interpret the `RM` coefficient (9.1021) by first noticing that the p-value (under `P>|t|`) is so small, basically zero. This means that the number of rooms, `RM`, is a statisticall significant predictor of `PRICE`. The regression coefficient for `RM` of 9.1021 means that *on average, each additional room is associated with an increase of $\\$9,100$ in house price net of the other variables*. The confidence interval gives us a range of plausible values for this average change, about ($\\$8,279, \\$9,925$), definitely not chump change. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the $\\hat{\\beta_i}, i > 0$ can be interpreted as the following: \"A one unit increase in $x_i$ is associated with, on average, a $\\hat{\\beta_i}$ increase/decrease in $y$ net of all other variables.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "The formula gives instruction for a general structure for a regression call. For `statsmodels` (`ols` or `logit`) calls you need to have a Pandas dataframe with column names that you will add to your formula. In the below example you need a pandas data frame that includes the columns named (`Outcome`, `X1`,`X2`, ...), but you don't need to build a new dataframe for every regression. Use the same dataframe with all these things in it. The structure is very simple:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "This is the very basic structure but it should be enough to get you through the homework. Things can get much more complex. You can force statsmodels to treat variables as categorical with the `C()` function, call numpy functions to transform data such as `np.log` for extremely-skewed data, or fit a model without an intercept by including `- 1` in the formula. For a quick run-down of further uses see the `statsmodels` [help page](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/example_formulas.html).\n"

    "  <li>**Linearity**. The dependent variable $Y$ is a linear combination of the regression coefficients and the independent variables $X$. This can be verified with a scatterplot of each $X$ vs. $Y$ and plotting correlations among $X$. Nonlinearity can sometimes be resolved by [transforming](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/318) one or more independent variables, the dependent variable, or both. In other cases, a [generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) or a [nonlinear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression) may be warranted.</li>\n",
    "  <li>**Constant standard deviation**. The SD of the dependent variable $Y$ should be constant for different values of X. We can check this by plotting each $X$ against $Y$ and verifying that there is no \"funnel\" shape showing data points fanning out as $X$ increases or decreases. Some techniques for dealing with non-constant variance include weighted least squares (WLS), [robust standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors), or variance stabilizing transformations.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "  <li> **Normal distribution for errors**.  The $\\epsilon$ term we discussed at the beginning are assumed to be normally distributed. This can be verified with a fitted values vs. residuals plot and verifying that there is no pattern, and with a quantile plot.\n",
    "  $$ \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "Sometimes the distributions of responses $Y$ may not be normally distributed at any given value of $X$.  e.g. skewed positively or negatively. </li>\n",

    "  <li>**Correlated Predictors:** Care should be taken to make sure that the independent variables in a regression model are not too highly correlated. Correlated predictors typically do not majorly affect prediction, but do inflate standard errors of coefficients making interpretation unreliable. Common solutions are dropping the least important variables involved in the correlations, using regularlization, or, when many predictors are highly correlated, considering a dimension reduction technique such as principal component analysis (PCA).\n",
    "  <li>**Influential Points:** Data points that have undue influence on the regression model. These points can be high leverage points or outliers. Such points are typically removed and the regression model rerun.\n",
