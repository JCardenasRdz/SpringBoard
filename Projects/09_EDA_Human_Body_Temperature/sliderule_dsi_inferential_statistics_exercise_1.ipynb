    "The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?"

    "<li>  Is the distribution of body temperatures normal? \n",
    "    <ul>\n",

    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Remember that this is a condition for the CLT, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why?\n",
    "    <li> In this situation, is it appropriate to use the $t$ or $z$ statistic? \n",
    "    <li> Now try using the other test. How is the result be different? Why?\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be \"abnormal\"?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Start by computing the margin of error and confidence interval.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> What test did you use and why?\n",
